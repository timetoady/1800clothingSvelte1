          All her life, Carma de Jong Anderson was fascinated with
          historical costumes. As she grew to maturity, her interest focused
          on clothing of the 1800s. On numerous occasions she was asked by
          the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints to consult with
          them on the restoration of historic sites of the Church, and the
          dressing of the docents there who represented families of those
          decades. Unfortunately, modern artists are not very familiar with
          authentic clothing worn by the people of the 1800s. Their
          paintings and illustrations often depict wild guesses as to what
          was worn.
        </p>
        <p>
          So Carma took it upon herself for over 40 years to travel
          extensively to museums, art galleries, historic sites, and to pour
          through images in antique books and magazines collecting detailed
          images of what people in the 1800s really wore. She earned a Ph.D.
          at BYU with a large, 3 volume doctoral dissertation showing what
          she had learned. Limited to a printing of only 6 three-volume
          copies, It was much in demand with artists in and outside of the
          Church of Jesus Christ LDS. She was asked to update it, enlarge
          it, and eventually put it online so anyone in the world could see
          the results of her decades of research, showing over 2000 images
          of correct clothing for each decade from the late 1820s to the
          1870s.

          This particular file deals with the 1829s to 1849s, when
          illustrations, paintings, and daguerreotypes were almost the only
          methods of visual recording from 1830 to 1860 when better means of
          photography became available. Each decade in this file begins with
          images of men and families, then women, then children, from basic
          clothing to hair styles to accessories. Each category begins with
          fashions of ordinary, laboring people, then of wealthier people.
          When all categories have been added to the website, anyone,
          anywhere will have access to authentic images of clothing of much
          of the 1800s.
