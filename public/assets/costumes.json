    "description": "Smocks were the most common working man's clothing of the 1700s & 1800s in both the old world and the new. This is a linen smock from America with smocking in front and a placket of four buttons. There is a little smocking at the collar line in center back. (It is not a \"round smock,\" which would have a placket on the back side as well, to allow wearing it reversed.) On the shoulders are double layers of linen that cover all raw edges, and are called the \"straps,\" for reinforcing the smock. Sometimes, a strongly made smock could be used for future generations. Nothing went to waste or was thrown away if there was still some use in it. American smock fronts have varied smocking designs, with only two inches of smocking on the cuff-lines of the sleeves. Note that the smocking does not go all the way around the cuffs, but is centered, and is there simply for beauty's sake. Other pleats in the sleeve fabric attach to the side of the cuff opening. Under the rectangular arm sections are the usual seveninch squares sewn into the sleeves and body as folded, triangular gussets. On the shoulders, the long “straps,” and the facings inside the smock, cover the raw seams of sleeve insertions and are pressed inward toward the neckline. This completely covers the raw edges of the sleeves and straps. All raw edges of the fabric are turned under with small, hand whip-stitching that is hardly seen on the outside of the smock, this adds strength to the garment. Such construction will survive generations of work and washing. At the bottom of the side seam (French-seamed) is a tiny gusset at the top of the side slit to prevent side-seam tearing. There is plenty of room within this smock for a farmer to comfortably lift hay, drive a team, etc. The smock could be any neutral color of linen or dyed to a dark navy blue or brown for little boys' smocks. In New England, Nova Scotia or Canada smocks could even be wool, subtly striped, and much longer. Wool would protect men better than linen from cold, rain, snow, and dirt.",

    "description": "Of the large Germanic Whitmer family in Fayette, New York, David Whitmer had a strong mind and body. Here he wears the usual American linen smock to cover his clothing while working. If the day were hot, a farmer might wear nothing on his torso except his tough linen smock. He also wears a broad-brimmed, low crowned hat and heavy leather work shoes. David's family hosted Joseph Smith, Jr. for one month while the Prophet used this safe place to get away from life-threatening mobs while translating the Book of Mormon from ancient gold plates into English.",

    "description": "This man's calf-length smock hadbeen repaired, as we can see a carefully reinforced seam just left of bottom center. A tear had taken place from the front hem and upward about 15 inches. Perhaps that split in the fabric was there when the smock was first made, many years before, and had been sewn up to prevent fraying. Then the fabric could still be used as good linen to create a long-sleeved smock for a man. This design has only a square of smocking stitches in top front, no wider than the flat collar spreads. All stitching and openings are identical on front and back, making it a reversible \"Round Smock.\" The sleeves have the expected section of smocking near the narrow cuffs, but not all the way around the cuffs. It had lasted a long time by being used on both, reversible sides for many years, or more than one generation. The owner donated it to the historic village. It is definitely a New England type of smock and is badly tacked up for this display. The shoulder width would have dropped a little off the farmer's shoulders when worn.",

His blouse has full front and back torso, and very full sleeves under a wide collar. His hat is flat with a long ribbon around the crown that falls to his shoulders. He also has a scarf tied under his collar. The trousers are the renowned, sailor bell-bottoms. If a sailor fell into the sea, he could lift a wet bell-bottom above the waves, trap air in the voluminous leg, and hold it tight at the bottom to provide a float. Wet fabric would hold the air in for a quite a while as he waited for help. Chances are good that many sailors on older ships wore not uniform sailor garb, but whatever they had in shirts or trousers. It probably depended on the strictness of the owner, and who was paying for his clothing.",

Woven Linen had to be soaked in water and then lain out on grasses to bleach in the sunlight. This was a dangerous time for textile makers because even in daylight the yardages of linen could be quickly stolen, denying the makers of their proper earnings after long seasons of work. Usually, the linens are laid out wet for 2-5 days of sunning and bleaching, being rinsed wet again each day.",

Washing the hair was considered unhealthy, since wet hair was believed to give a woman chills, inflammation of the lungs, and lead to worse disease. An ordinary mobcap was cut from a circle of cloth, with a casing spaced in an inch or two in from the edge, and threaded with string to draw it snug.",

Even the poorest woman would never leaver her home without some sort of bonnet on, and often would not even go outdoors in her own yard, lest the sun brown her alabaster complexion. Note the other style, which was rather an enlarged cap to surround the piled-up hairdo, but with ruffled lace around the face and under the chin and back hair, with openings for the ears. It tied under the chin. One supposes that a woman wearing this style would also carry a parasol against the sun. It was a common undertaking for a woman to buy fal-lals to redecorate her bonnets for various seasons and occasions. The black bonnet with black ribbons, bottom right, was probably a mourning bonnet, which should be worn for 6 months to 2 years after the death of a loved one (depending on a woman’s closeness to the deceased. Widow = 2 years. Parent or child = 1 year. Other relatives, 6 months or so).",

His hat is an odd-shaped felt with a folded-up brim. His straight trousers are rolled at the ankles, a sign he has bought them second or third hand.",

His walking stick is a tree branch. A crushed hat is felt, and his boots seem to be of rough animal skins. Sheepskin, worn fun-side in would look like this and be warm in cold weather. His woven reed basket may be for collecting and then selling what he finds. The carts in the background may haul coal from the mines. If so, he might collect small chunks that have fallen out, and take them to a nearby village to sell.",

Neither is his short blue coat, which may once have had tails or a frock-skirt, but no longer does. His front-fall trousers are loose-legged as in 1820s. A handkerchief dangles from a front pocket. The woman chewing out the man wears a knotted scarf over her hair, and a shawl tucked in beneath her apron. Her blouse sleeves are rolled to the elbow for hard work, and her apron (and everything else) is quite grubby. She wears stockings and wooden shoes with typical up- tipped points. *Cummerbund is the original spelling, but so many people mispronounce and misspell it as cumBerbund, that Webster now lists that as a secondary spelling. That’s how language evolves.",

The lapel portion of the coat body was minimal – perhaps an inch. Coat collars were padded and stiffened to stand far up behind the neck, often as high as the ears, to frame the face and cravat. Tops of the sleeves are gathered to poof out and make the shoulders look wider. Waists were nipped in, often with men wearing corsets or girdles. Both carry whips and have high, flared top hats.

It looks as if it’s made of metal, but if it were, it would be a torture device of horrifying brutality, causing lifelong disabilities of bone and organs. Historically, however, for the coveted prize of “in-fashion beauty,” many torture devices have continued throughout history. Pointed shoes and very high heels are instances.",

    "description": "For many decades it was touted by manufacturers and some very ignorant doctors that a corset would help children grow up with good posture. Never mind that it disabled full breathing, development of torso muscles, and normal positioning of internal organs, it was STYLE! Hundreds of such ads throughout the 1800s can be found for children from infant age to girls on the brink of womanhood. Wearing a corset would accustom a young girl to wearing an ever smaller-waisted corset in womanhood, causing any number of health problems. No wonder they were always fainting. One alleged story tells of an angry husband of the 1880s who cast his unfaithful wife onto the street without her corset. So undeveloped were her torso muscles that she could not even get up and walk to safety, but lay helpless in the road. But whoever said fashion had anything to do with natural beauty, or natural health? Look what some young people do to their bodies, hair, and outfits in the 21st century, with fluorescent-colored hair, ripped clothing, and tattoos everywhere.",

A red silk handkerchief dangles from the “pocket” through a slit in the apron. (More such pockets are seen in Women’s Accessories.) The apron’s bound slit in the side lets a woman’s hand reach into the convenient pocket that holds valuables like money, handkerchief, little children's toys, or small books to take along. Barely above her gold apron, we see a bit of the white cords sewn to the blue pocket and tied in back. Beneath the short gown, a skirt covers petticoats and chemise. The skirt is black and red striped, very heavy folk cotton. The hem facing on the skirt is made of green cotton scraps and is barely seen at the bottom of both photos, showing how they used anything available for meeting the simple needs of work clothing.",

Ruffles could be sewn onto the shirt front opening, as show in the first image. The opening was fastened closed with hooks or buttons, or with decorative studs.

White pants are probably strapped under his feet because they are straight with no wrinkles. The seated man has a pale-colored, satin, double-breasted vest over a white shirt with a high, white, buttonon cravat. His frock coat is unbuttoned. His trousers are tight and strapped under pointed-toe shoes. The teen-age boy’s frockcoat would be brightly colored with a short skirt to his thighs. His white pants meet black riding boots with pale yellow, turnover tops. The man on right wears Cossack pants with fullness at the waistline, narrowing down fashionably at the ankles. His coat is a claw-hammer style that shows off his pants. Standing men wear shiny silk top hats.",

A cravat is inside that collar, below his chin. We assume they would be great for very cold weather. Right - The dark blue, double cloak has a solid lower half without a visible opening, which would be handy in a wet storm. It likely opens beneath the upper portion, though that might require stepping in and out of the garment. The top cape allows freedom for his arms to move outside of the cloak, and a velvet collar keeps his neck warm.",

However, goat hair in fabric does not allow perfect retention of the dyed color, thus the combination. Three wooden toggle buttons close the cloak from neck to waist.",

The coat lapels are quite wide in an1830s style. His vest has shawl-style lapels with a dozen small brass buttons. The tie is black and narrow with a small knot. Because it is a summer dress suit, the legs are straight and narrow. His hat is of fine, leghorn-weave straw with a square crown and a wide brim--large enough for a Southern planter to wear. The pale straw is achieved by being enclosed in smoking sulfur. The leghorn category comes from split straws for very fine, dense braiding In the Nineteenth Century, The brim is turned up around the edge. Black shoes would have been worn with white stockings, or he could have chosen flat-heeled dress slippers with slightly squared toes.",

On ordinary days he often preached outdoors, sometimes from a wagon box while wearing any of his ordinary work clothing. He did not always \"dress the part\" of a prophet, for he had much work to do of all kinds, including travel, farming, and helping his family. The founding of the Church took place in Fayette, New York at the home of Christian Whitmer Sr.'s family.

    "description": "Here we see Oliver Cowdery in a finely tailored coat that replaced his much worn-out one. He chose the elegant style of a Chesterfield with a black velvet collar. We are unable to see the buttons but they may have been covered with dark brown heavy silk. His sleeves are fashionably narrow, showing narrow rims of shirt cuffs. The shoulder line is a good demonstration of the lack of padding in men's shoulders in the early 1840s which had emphasized a popular sloping line. With a simple black tie over a pleated-bosom shirt, his vest is actually a darker tone of brown than the coat. It was made of heavy silk, not wool. His trousers were very dark, as was the fashion. Oliver appears taut-skinned, thinner than ever before, and we know he was slowly dying of tuberculosis, as so many people in his generation were. His hair is combed straight, but flipping out over the ears. He was not a very large man and had small-boned, graceful hands. Oliver Cowdery was the primary scribe who wrote the text of the Book of Mormon as Joseph Smith Jr. dictated the 531 pages to him during most of the 65 days before publication. He also testified to his death that he indeed saw the gold plates of the Book of Mormon, shown to him by an angel.",

His trousers were sturdy cotton in cream color, with strong muslins for pockets and facings. He also put on correctly smooth white stockings with very simple low shoes of black leather. It was a rare and delightful curiosity to see a wedding like this with a ”country preacher” performing the wedding service. His wife had a pretty ensemble and it all worked out happily. He was thrilled to have his picture taken as I posed him in various ways in the public park in advance of the wedding. A true romantic at heart!",

His tie is pre-made black silk in a wide band fastening in back, fronted by a bow with pointed ends. His white linen shirt is the standard pull-over that has pleats in front. A button-on collar stands up, stiff with starch, and wraps from the front to the back, where it becomes narrow, only ¾ inch high, allowing button fastening. His shirt cuffs properly show at the end of his coat sleeves. Charles’ hair of gentle waves has ample sideburns and comes down to the top of his collar in back.

His hair is brushed forward over the temples, as was often preferred, (perhaps in an attempt to hide the loss of receding hair.) On each cheekbone, his sideburns extend into small \"muttonchops\" and are bright, curly orange. Bell’s high coat collar in back shows perfectly the way coats were padded to slope sharply from shoulder to neck, as was done in the late 1830s. Part of a button is seen just below the M-cut of his lapel, which would indicate a double-breasted coat. A high, stand-up shirt collar of stiff white linen lies against his jawbone, and a white silk tie is wrapped around the collar with not much of a knot in front. Note that the very high collar is cut into a dip in the back to avoid discomfort to neck and hairline. White ruffles spill down the bosom of his shirt. He was evidently a landed gentleman to wear such finery. Bell appears to be in his mid-30s.",

    "description": "Large brims spread out in great circles to frame the face, with all manner of frills on the inside and outside of the brim. The crowns in the back thrust out enough to be sometimes called “bucket crowns,” which they resembled. They were ornamented with every manner of flowers, feathers, frills, ribbons, and laces. Non-typical bonnets like the two in the lower corners look more like a pile of ruffles and ribbons than actual bonnets. Occasionally, when the inner brim closed in on the forehead, as does the green hat seen in center bottom, artificial curls in a woman’s natural hair color could be attached to peek out of the inside of the hat. See an example on next page below. The top left blue hat has a ruffle sewn into the brim to look as if she is wearing her day cap beneath. Among the wealthy, clothing décor was so over-the-top it was almost indecent. Among the middle-class and poor the décor ranged from moderate to nothing beyond the most basic head covering. Women who could afford trims bought new ones with each season to redecorate their basic hats.",

She depends on the skills of wigmakers and the hair they buy from the poorer classes to make up her abundant curls and braids. Note the headband across her forehead – very popular in the 1830s. Her dress has the horizontal pleating over the bustline and enormous puffed sleeves of the era. Many women and children throughout the 1800s wore coral bead necklaces that were believed to ward off illness. They are seen in many other portraits.

No boy of any age would have stood for strangling corsets. The frockcoat skirts have much gathering in the back and an inset waistband with upper and lower points. We see a red waistcoat and the shirt with ruffled yoke and neck wrapped in a gold cravat of some kind. All the boys have puffy trousers, slimming at the ankles. Such trousers are realistic in the 1830s. The boy far left wears a “skeleton suit,” a top and trousers buttoned together at the waist. He, too, has exaggerated puffed-top sleeves that would have required stuffing or stiffening to maintain their shapes. His hat is probably modeled after a Turkish cap, but is orange, more conical, and has a front bill. Two boys have long, curled hair to their shoulders. The boy in blue has feathers and ornaments attached to his cap.

His trousers are buff or white with under-shoe straps. The Lady’s riding habit is usual with a tiny waist, and huge balloon sleeves dropped over her shoulder. She has the usual extra-long hem that will modestly cover her feet as she rides side-saddle. What is unique is that she wears trousers under her skirt, a smart feature this author has never seen illustrated before. They even strap under her shoes. She wears the usual top hat with a veil, and her hair froths with curls to below her ears. A wide, velvet, bodice opening shows a fancy blouse beneath, with a multi-colored cravat held by a broach. Also unusually, she has no gloves.",

Her mother, Emma's, dress has bouffant sleeves at the top and diagonal pleating across the corsage of the bodice. The solid blue and flowered stripes alternate in a beautiful example of 1835 fabric. On April 30, 1831, Emma Smith lost her own premature infant twins in death. The same night, Julia Murdock died giving birth to twins. Following all this grief, John Murdock gave his twins to Joseph and Emma, who wanted to adopt them. The Murdock twins were a balm to Joseph and Emma’s broken hearts and John was assured of his children’s loving care.",

An open crotch was convenient on infants and toddlers for changing diapers or potty training without disrobing the entire child.

    "description": "In this clothing detail of the 1847 W. S. Mount painting, Liquor Loss and Gain, we see the result of habitual drinking on an older man who loses the dearly loved stuff that has made him clumsy and careless. He wears a half-buttoned pull-on shirt, trousers torn at the knee and frayed at the hem but held up by beige suspenders, and clutches the brown and red vest he has shed. He wears no stockings in his square toed shoes. His hat might be felt or straw, and has a red bandanna stuffed inside as it falls. In his inebriation, he has obviously taken no care for his appearance in some time. Mount’s opinion of drinking was expressed to a friend: “….To come square to the point with you my dear friend–I must tell you that liquor drinking is a nuisance….Drinking causes one to be stupid, and to lose ambition about business, and indifference about personal appearance….As for myself, I have drilled my will power so, for the past year–that I can sit and look at bottles without any inclination to drink.” — William Sydney Mount, Letter to James Baxter, April, 1857. — (Image and quotation from: http://www.aaqeastend.com/content/william-sydney-mount-american-genre-painter/ )",

    "description": "A detail of a very large painting called Defense of Nauvoo shows four men in working clothes preparing to defend their city from its final, destructive mobs. The man far left cleans his rifle while wearing a blue barn coat and tan trousers with a pale straw hat. The next man wears a white linen or cotton shirt with gray trousers tucked into his boots. Next right is a man in a brown vest over his white shirt, with brown trousers and another rifle. The man far right in the typical red work shirt of light wool flannel over brown trousers has a powder horn slung over his shoulder. Of headgear, the two on the left are fairly flat straw hats, while the two on the right are felt with higher, rounded crowns. This example of C.C.A. Christensen's series of 10 paintings (each about 8 ft. by 10 ft.) was created during his winter rest times away from farming. He depicted early Mormon history and pioneers, and exhibited them in many cities of Mormons, north, and south, in the “Mormon Corridor” of settlements from Arizona to Northern Idaho. He linked the paintings together in a long roll, which was easiest for transporting. To each group of viewers in his journeys, Christensen explained his prepared story of early Mormon History. He unwound the scroll and described scene by scene from his wagon box if it was a small village. If possible he spoke in a primitive chapel or at a farmyard gathering --charging observers a small-price. Christensen’s efforts to show his arts gave him a slightly increased income through the long winters in the west and also allowed him to demonstrate his deep-seated beliefs. Authenticity of clothing in his paintings was not completely accurate or detailed, even on such large paintings. He had not, after all, seen the events himself in their time period.",

Only a blanket covers his trunk and legs. Moccasins replace worn-out boots. Many nearly died from lack of water in the worst deserts of the area now Nevada. They welcomed the greenery of Yerba Buena (San Francisco). Some Battalion members stayed to found San Bernardino as a productive Mormon settlement, but most made their way back east to their people in Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory. The march was so miserable that few of the Battalion would talk about it later. Many brought their pay to Brigham Young to sacrifice in aid of other Mormons coming west across the Great Plains.",

Notice that for the first time, shirts are buttoning up the entire front, whereas, in earlier decades they were pull-overs with only 3 to 4 buttons at the neck. Strauss was a Bavarian fabric dealer in 1850 San Francisco. He briefly participated in the gold rush, where he designed his famous trousers made of a tough cotton twill fabric called \"denim.\" It is made of blue threads on the outside and white threads on the inside of the fabric, securely woven together. \"Levis\" had a center-front, buttoned closure, unusual at the time. Other miners quickly requested such pants, and soon his great fortune was made!",

The pale straw is achieved by being enclosed in smoking sulfur. The leghorn category comes from split straws for very fine, dense braiding In the Nineteenth Century, The brim is turned up around the edge.

These big men were depicted conventionally with tiny feet to indicate their refinement, and all their hair was smoothly coifed, even to Hyrum's characteristically long sideburns. They both wore light, strapped-under trousers with darker tailcoats, and sleeve cuffs turned down formally. It is barely discernible that Hyrum is also wearing a light, if not white, vest, as is Joseph. This artist made the Prophet taller than his older brother, which was not true to their actual heights but was meant to emphasize Joseph’s No.1 importance. Hyrum was actually 2 to 2 ½ inches taller than Joseph and was lean and lanky with a narrower forehead.",

    "description": "Joseph Smith at a table, writing. This excellent mannequin was made by Church Displays long ago. Carma designed his clothing: the first representation, ever, of the Prophet Joseph Smith wearing LINEN, which was appropriate and much used in the hot, humid weather of the Midwest. He is seated at an Empire style table made at the time of his birth, 1806. His frock coat is of pumpkin-colored linen with a pleated opening in the center back skirt. Thin white piping surrounds all edges of his coat but the hemline. Pocket flaps over his hips are sewn into the waistline seam and are also piped in white. Buttons in the front tabs are medium-sized while those on the coat cuffs are small. Two buttons at the back waistline pleats are large. All are made to look like the correct white bone for that period. This design was made after a white linen frock coat which was an 1845 antique Carma bought in the Northeast USA (shown elsewhere). Smith's trousers are cotton/linen of narrow, equal stripes of beige and soft green. They have bottom straps, buttoned under the shoe sole to hold trousers neatly down on the leg. A vest of mottled beige linen with a shawl collar covers his fine white linen shirt. Small black and gold designs grace the silky cravat which wraps around his standing collar to button in the back. His boots have proper square toes.",
    "source": "SOURCES: The LDS Historic Sites Exhibits made this accurate mannequin and originally put it in Joseph Smith’s Vermont Birthplace Site. However, the clothing was totally incorrect. Later they enlarged the site and asked Carma to make new and better clothes. She dressed him entirely in linen for the hot sticky weather of the Midwest, seated at a Nauvoo table with assorted papers he owned and used. Never before had he been shown wearing proper linen for an Illinois summer. Years later, when this exhibit was exchanged for another, it was all transported to Salt Lake City and warehoused. In the 1980s, Carma desired some of the clothing for display, and the Church gave her the entire mannequin, plus the use of Church furniture. It was placed behind glass in the 2005 Joseph Smith 200th Birthday Exhibit in the Joseph Smith Building on BYU Campus. Carma made all this clothing and used her own 1840s books to display on the table. The exhibit extended to 6 months, allowing 33,000 people to view this scene of 11 dressed mannequins over the summer and into winter. It joined with displays showing men, women, and children of Joseph's entire lifetime (1805-1844). Clothing and hair designed by Carma, and clothing made by Carma. All the white piping on the coat was finished by her granddaughter Rachel, a 15-year-old assistant in Vermont. Free use."

    "description": "n this daguerreotype, the uncle of Joseph Smith Jr. wore very dark trousers with a matching coat, this suit was a new fashion in men’s clothing. An old vest of the l830s is buttoned up very high, but shows the silk of his tie. His frock coat is completely skirted, and his shoulders are free of padding, making them narrow at the sleeve tops. Above a starched, turned-down collar and a bow tie, Smith still had considerable gray hair cut below his earlobes (portrait of face and hairstyle is elsewhere in this document). Even with the best of clothes in the mid-1800s, it was impossible to keep shined shoes because of muddy or dusty roads of hard beaten earth everywhere people could walk. This gentle man lived a very reverent and spiritual life to his death. Smith was tall and lanky all his life, which caused unusual difficulties for photographers. They always used photo stands to hold the necks of subjects steady for the full required time of exposing the image. But the man had to find enough books to stack behind John in order to get his stand high enough to grip the back of John’s neck. The stand is seen behind John’s calves, humorously resting on top of the stacked books. Still, the slight blur of his hands indicates a little movement. The necessity of remaining perfectly motionless for up to 90 seconds is why most old photos show unsmiling faces. After his brother, Joseph Smith Sr. died in Nauvoo, John became Patriarch to the entire Church. Later, in Salt Lake City, John was called by Brigham Young to be president of the first large Salt Lake Stake. A “stake” is a collection of 5 to 15 congregations, or “wards.”",

When Joseph sent him to England to open a mission, he was horrified to have to face many well-dressed, educated English people: but he felt called by God and was determined to go. A former friend, Lyman Johnson, met him on the streets of early Nauvoo, and, learning of his intense desire to go, took the fine cloak off his own back, and put it on Heber. Johnson, himself, was faltering in the LDS Church at that time but was so impressed with Kimball’s strong faith, he donated his own best cloak to Kimball to encourage him! Such clothing would be absolutely necessary to cross the Atlantic and brave the winds and rains of Britain. This cloak most likely had an expensive rain caplet over the shoulders, valuable for Heber's years in Britain, with much walking outdoors to preach.",

This photo is only part of the original, which had a broad rain collar over the shoulders and a blue velvet collar at the neck. We see a beautifully-shaped velvet guard over each arm-slit, with tiny blue velvet buttons added for decoration. The neckline is closed with two metal buttons and a chain between. It was made by Smith's favorite Nauvoo tailor, Colonel Bills of the Nauvoo Legion, who gave it to beloved Joseph as a gift. The lining of \"bear cloth\" is a 1inch thick shag of faded wool woven into a dense fur-like fabric, which would prove enormously warm. Carma handled the cloak and pulled open the yarns of the lining. There she found that it was not originally brown, but bright green in the early construction of the cloak. The cloak was handed back to the Bills family after Joseph’s death. They wore it for at least another generation during which the outside fabric was torn and heavily mended in different colors of thread. Someone in the tailor's family could have taken off the wide upper rain collar and used it for a little child’s coat.",

Two rows of eight brass buttons close the double-breasted jacket. The lining of the jacket and tails is of gold silk with bands of gold embroidery on the tails. A white, linen shirt is worn beneath the jacket showing a bit at the collar and wrist. Unseen beneath his black leather belt is a narrow red sash of heavy knitted silk, of which we see long ends hanging vertically with silk floss tassels. All officers wore such a sash. On some copies of this picture, the sash may seem to be gold, but Carma has handled the red silk sash, which fits snuggly because it is knitted. His knee-high boots are smooth black leather with a low heel. Attached to the belt on his left is the sheath for his drawn sword, which he holds in the painting. Nearby, on a small table, sits his black felt bicorn hat, which has two sides of the brim fastened up at the top with one secure gold star and two hanging gold stars. Much black silk braid reaches from the headband over the top of the brim and back down again to the headband. Also added are two or three black ostrich plumes. Many copies of this oil painting were made, including the flaws caused by excessive handling during travel in wagons west.",

He has more hair than his famous brothers, and long sideburns, neatly clipped. The Richards family were of wealthy stock in the Eastern United States, many of the younger members converted to the LDS Church. Franklin lived until 1899 with three generations of relatives around him as Mormon leaders.",

A starched collar stands up against his jaw, and his white tie is probably silk, wrapped twice around his neck and tied in a short, squared knot or bow. Shirt studs are not apparent. Some person long ago used white paint to mask the background of this image in an amateurish way, leaving Joseph with a chopped-in, unnatural hairstyle, often promulgated by artists, but which was not how his hair actually looked (see internet images for bad examples). Carma had Joseph's hair slightly retouched in this image to look as it naturally did. Joseph does not have sideburns in this portrait, but his side hair is brushed forward. Those who knew Joseph said his hair was light brown to blond, with a touch of red.",
    "source": "SOURCE: The following message is attached to the bottom of the daguerreotype: “Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1879, by JOSEPH SMITH [probably III], in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington.” We do not know who the daguerreotypist was, but it was placed in the Library of Congress many years after Joseph’s death."

The pumpkin-colored, linen coat has white piping on all edges, modeled after an authentic white linen Eastern American coat of 1845 in Carma’s collection (seen elsewhere). His vest is an original antique made of heavy white cotton pique. The linen shirt collar is triple thick and heavily starched to stand up at the jaw-line. Carma chose a cream and black silk tie with tiny figures. The pullover shirt has a front yoke 8 by 10 inches long of box pleating in the white linen. Joseph’s actual hair was dull blond or lightest brown, according to the claims of 19 acquaintances, and had a tiny touch of red. A swatch of hair, clipped from Joseph's head after his assassination, was held in Carma’s hand, as was Hyrum’s hair.2 The Prophet's dear brother's hair was a dull light brown. Both locks are beautiful and have inspired many tears.",
    "source": "This mannequin was displayed for 9 years in the Joseph Smith Birthplace historic site in Vermont. It was displayed in other Seminary and Institute buildings in the West for thousands more people to see.

He has merely outlined the clothing, but has taken pains with the face. Joseph wears a coat of late 1830s or early 1840s, as shown by some gathering in the top of the sleeve and the collar riding high on the back on his neck. His coat sleeve cuffs have buttons, but are open and turned back to show his shirt sleeve. The double-breasted coat opening has fashionable buttonhole strips on each lapel-- which were never buttoned all the way up, but were simply the fashion for coats. Buttons and buttonholes on the same side meant it could be buttoned closed in either direction, right or left. Paintings and drawings of this time showed men with rather hefty torsos. In reality, the men were probably more slim and flat-waisted than their portraits, but a well-padded stomach indicated that the man had sufficient means to eat well.",

His shirt front is impeccable and probably starched in tucks, with collar standing up stiffly and starched cuffs apparent. His black cravat is tied in a barrel knot. His wide lapels have buttonholes almost up to the collar, and his vest of satin has many tiny buttons, not all buttoned. Well educated Henrietta Williams had recently turned 16 in this demure image. She wears a striped silk dress with narrow sleeves cut on the bias beneath V-shaped caplets at the shoulders. Shirring across the shoulders is gathered into the V-shape bodice with a very full skirt below. A black velvet neck ribbon is crossed and held with a modish square broach, and a long watch-chain descends to her skirt. To one side of her smooth hair-do, she has tucked a white flower. After Dr. Lewis was called to treat this fragile young woman for some months, he found he wanted to have her forever. They saw each other occasionally with parents' discretion and he married her four years later.",

Jennetta’s dark colored silk dress has beautiful shirring on the bodice, with an obvious busk in the center-front point to prevent midriff wrinkles in the dress. Darker braid decorations are on her caplet sleeves, and down the sides of the front. A gold chain holds a pocket watch tucked into a bodice pocket. She wears a white embroidered linen collar and scalloped cuffs. Her day cap has excessive ruching on the side of each cheek. Son Heber John, holding hands with his mother, is dressed like a little man in a double breasted jacket of wool plaid, with metal buttons and a multi-colored silk tie. Sadly, they had few years together before she died in Nauvoo in 1845. Richards was the private secretary to his cousin Joseph Smith, and was later second Councilor to President Brigham Young. Before joining the LDS church he was a pharmacist, widely sought as a practicing doctor. Jennetta was a wealthy girl of renowned beauty and fragile health. She was a daughter of a British minister whose congregation was decimated by conversion to the LDS church. Heber was madly in love with beautiful Jeanette, who was well worthy as a fine Christian convert to the Mormon Church, taught and baptized by Heber C. Kimball. This photo shows obvious family affection.",

He wears a light-colored coat. The vigorous line dancing shows women in very full skirts and often little jackets over their dresses with a peplum over the skirt. The jackets button up the front.

Her navy, wide-neck dress has diagonal tucks from shoulder to center front point, and her skirt has un-pressed pleats for its massive width. Sarah’s long, dark hair is in multiple braids looped around her ears, with an unseen bun in back. A woman liked to show off her pretty, shell-like ears.",

They are stabilized by three rows of trim, which each form a shallow V. At each trim point is a black, circular rosette. Below that are elbow puffs and white lace cuffs. A wide, detached, semi-sheer collar has striking embroidery of a stem with leaves and flowers. She holds a traditional white mourning handkerchief. A thin blue ribbon around her neck holds her silver watch, peeking from a watch pocket on her bodice. In this portrait, we see a style of wearing a side comb to hold a curl in front of the ear. She also has two slender strands of ribbon around her drawn-back hair to secure the comb firmly in place. A necklace of gold beads, very popular, circles her throat. A gold ring is on her index finger.",

    "description": "Emma’s habit is a long skirt and separate bodice with at least 45 tiny (probably silver) buttons sewn onto narrow tape decorations. She favors the military effect. Her jacket collar is turned up and lined with a Betsy Collar from an Empire-high blouse for riding. There are 1840-style epaulet (cap) sleeves over her long-narrow ones. The edges of the epaulets even have buttons and tape on them. Her cuffs expose a white frill at the wrist. The left side of her skirt is two feet longer at the hemline, which modestly shields her ankles while she is mounted side-saddle. She holds up some excess length, and we can glimpse only the front of her narrow, square-tipped shoe style. (It was considered a titillation of male desire if a man walked near an exposed, easily-touched ankle.) She wears white stockings and black leather slippers with some heel on them to secure the foot in a stirrup. She holds an ivory-handled crop, one of two she owned (still in private collections). Her black silk bonnet was removed and placed on the table to feature her profile. The bonnet has a fine, black, silk, lace veil to float behind her while she rides. The inside of the bonnet brim is a flattering shade of pale pink to reflect on her face. Her natural dark hair is pulled back in a high bun, with two sections of hair on the front sides twisted into ringlets, bound together with small cords to hang in front of her ears with her bonnet on. When this painting is seen close up, as Carma has held it in her hands, it is possible to see sets of combs that keep Emma's hair smooth on each side of her head, each positioned forward at eyebrow height. Watercolor by Sutcliffe Maudsley, whose strength was to paint profiles. The fictitious drape with gold fringe at top right is customarily added by the artist as \"the drape of honor\" in a portrait.",

The bodice and sleeves are cut on the bias, which makes both a better fit on the model and more puff in the sleeves. The bodice front has a false band with buttons, (though it actually has a back opening with a hidden, modern zipper for the lady-missionary's convenience) that is made to look like old hooks. The sleeves are shirred in six lines around the top, then backed with a flat piece of the same fabric and fit into the slightly dropped armholes. The sleeves are very full at the wrist, and gathered into a narrow buttoned band. All the seams in back and around the waistline and neckline are self-corded. Six inches above the hemline is a shirred bias band with a larger decorative cording top and bottom to make a pleasing self-décor (and much work sewing correctly). The back side of the hem is faced in polished cotton of a cheaper fabric, as was done for hundreds of years before textiles became inexpensive.",

Betty Robinson of Spanish Fork, UT made this beautiful dress of quality purple calico with special pleated trim. Betty created a pleating-cardboard to make tiny, uniform pleats for the flanges over the shoulders in front and back, plus wide borders on the sleeves, and a border for the entire hemline of the skirt. Petticoats are layered beneath, as the heavy hem design requires much support. Bell-shaped sleeves cover embroidered engageants. The collar and engageants were made by Betty with machine embroidery, as are the lovely designs on the lappets which hang on both sides of the day cap. The model, Molly Hansen Lysenko, has her hair twisted into a bun high in back, so the day cap only reaches across the top of her head, rather than covering the hair. This fine dress is worn with white, fingerless, lace gloves.",

This glossy silk dress uses elongated paisley shapes which are simplified into the intriguing design of two darker colors with white. Like many dresses of this time, a shirred bodice gathers diagonally, starting from a shoulder blade seam in the upper-back, draping forward over the shoulder into a solid shirring at the center waistline. The gathering appears to be smocked at the waist. Amy wears a small lace collar and a line of white on her cuffs. The narrow sleeves are bias cut and fit easily around the bend of arms. Her 1840s, sheer day cap has ribbon bows on the sides, and untied, curling, silk ribbons dangling down. Amy was the daughter of John Hyde, a minister near Rochester, NY,",

Though she and her husband, Norman, both joined the LDS faith, he cooled in his religious feelings and left Presendia, but she remained in full faith.

A gold chain around his neck for a flat watch seems to be tucked into an upper \\welt pocket on his vest. He wears very short curly hair and a neatly shaved and trimmed jaw-line beard from his sideburns.

Dresses with layers of light, white petticoats were beautiful and comfortable for the wealthy who could afford them and had maids to care for their clothing. Such dresses required delicate hand-washing, much ironing, and constant pressing between wearings. The hot days of summer were made more comfortable without tight silks over corsets. Popular in the British Isles and America, beautiful Ayrshire designs of white-on-white embroidery were imported or purchased during trips abroad. Many weddings made the most of delicate white lawn, batiste, and very beautiful muslin, often with added laces and shirring in sections of bodice or sleeves. These could be used for weddings only as economics would allow for pure white and elaborate sewing skills.",

    "description": "As famous as any single picture among Mormons, is this 1842 portrait by an unknown traveling artist in Nauvoo, revealed the powerful personality of Emma Hale Smith in a face that was just a little \"prettied up.\" Her clothing is remarkably beautiful: first a tucker or chemisette over the shoulders which was tied around the waist under the dress. Over that is a dress with a deep wide neckline. Then the white silk shoulder shawl with an embroidered collar added. The simple shawl was a fringed square folded in a triangle, with the 2 or 4-inch knotted fringe tied from the warp and weft of the fabric itself. Her hollow gold beads had been popular for the previous 20 years in America. The embroidery on the tucker and collar appears to have been hand-stitched, though machine embroidery was in high fashion in the 1840s. Small, ordinary home sewing machines would not be owned by the general population for another 25 years. The triangle points of edge-embroidery on the sheer mull or organza collar, are flowers and ferns. It possibly came as a gift to the Prophet's wife from England or might have been purchased in St. Louis. The “great medallion” of lace above her bodice has a geometric band around the neck and was of the highest quality. Part or all may have been done by Emma herself over a long time or was made by British embroiderers in Nauvoo. Emma wears a wedding ring on her left hand. Her ringlets are attached hairpieces, very common in the 1840s.",

She wears very modest hair close to her head with small combs to keep it neat. She did not have enough thick or long hair to make a substantial bun. She has a patrician profile with lovely blue eyes that match her blue dress. Her shawl is an unusual fold of a square with silk fringe. In each corner is outstanding white embroidery on the white silk. Mary, herself, could have done this needlework, as she was well trained in the arts and other literary education. She has not folded the square shawl into a triangle but has simply folded it in half, which makes it pleat a few times in fitting over her shoulders.",

A very wide summer neckline has shirring from the top that gathers tightly in the center front of her bodice. A set-in waistband connects the bodice to the large, gathered skirt. This thin English book muslin has tiny prints in horizontal lines. Her short sleeves end above the elbow. They, with the neckline, have a tiny edging of gathered lace. England imported many kinds of fibers to weave into different shapes of hats, but this hat appears to have been designed and made in the tropics, probably the English tropical colonies. The model wears proper white stockings and black slippers. Such a dress design and fabric was probably seen in America on those who could find and afford the fabric. This is the thin muslin used in the back binding of books, thus the name, “book muslin.”",

But this is an illusion because the dress seems to button down the front from the neckline. The dress could be any color from greens, blues, browns, or purples, but not likely black. This Staffordshire woman from England was from a frugal family and was trained as a housekeeper and provider of household needs. She was an excellent cook and baker. A knitter all her life, in her youth she was a dairymaid for a wealthy estate in Derbyshire, William Blood was the farm foreman who fell in love with Mary and wed her in 1836 in Broughton. They moved and started a bakery in Burton-on-Trent. William was a Railroad plate layer while Mary ran the shop but sadly lost their first baby boy. She avidly saved a great deal of money so they could take their next children to America with the Mormons. Most converts were not able to pay for their own emigration. They arrived in New Orleans, 1844. The Prophet Joseph Smith was sorry that William died 3 weeks after arrival, leaving Mary with 3 children. Mary gave birth to Emma in May 1844, and the infant quickly died. She bravely purchased 10 acres north of Nauvoo and would not be crushed by the deaths nor assassinations in Nauvoo. She saw that Brigham Young was approved of Joseph to lead the people West. Henry Wooley was also from Staffordshire, England, and came on the same ship as the Bloods. As he applied to work on Mary's house, their romance sprang up, and she married him in 1845. He was especially good to his step-children",

At17 she met the tall, dark-eyed pilot of the ship crossing Lake Ontario. She and Frederick Granger Williams (see elsewhere) were married in 1815 and moved to Kirtland, Ohio, where her husband practiced medicine. They had four children and happily joined the new Mormons as the Church became larger and larger. Despite her family’s hostility toward the Church, this early convert remained faithful and devoted to her covenants with her Father in Heaven and her Lord Jesus Christ.",

While in Toronto, Leonora went to the Methodist church, and there met John Taylor. He worked as a lathe turner, carving wood, and had enough education and striking personality to attract her.

    "description": "A cap of 9-inch, edged lace is fashioned into a day cap. The straight edge was gathered into the center back where it is neatly stitched into a circle of shirring. The front decorative edge surrounds the face and extends down in small lappets on each side. Narrow black ribbon makes the cap seams stronger and ends in bows at the back neckline. There are no tie-ons. Black would be worn for the first year after a loss in death. Then gray, lavender,and white could be introduced for the second year for a women’s formal mourning. Only some of the converted LDSadhered to this calendar of mourning from their former cultures. In Nauvoo during the 1840s, black death-carriages were rented for the funeral parade of the prophets, Joseph and Hyrum Smith. For months at the end of Nauvoo’s history in 1845, most people were in deep personal grieving,and many wore all the black clothing they owned.Later LDSconverts or other cross-country settlers had no opportunity in all their travels to adhere to such strict clothing rules. Pioneers breaking ground in Kansas, Lutherans going to Minnesota, or Protestants or Catholics on their way to Oregon and California had all buried loved ones from young to old along their journeys. Immigrants on ships coming from Europe, those traveling the Great Plains, and many struggling through deserts and forests northward or westward could only survive on what clothing they hadwith them.",

The sleeve style is from 15 years previous. On her shoulders is an elegantly embroidered collar which could be smaller for the 1840s. Around her neck is a ribbon attached to the pocket watch in her front bodice pocket or waistband. A handkerchief shows she is still grieving for her husband, Joseph. Her hair is in a large bun surrounded by braids.",

In some places, there were “workhouses” set up to feed the destitute minimal food and give them a place to sleep in exchange for slave labor and horrifying conditions. Such are the children in the novel, Oliver Twist, by Charles Dickens. Such are the children in this daguerreotype, boys captured by police as young thieves, male prostitutes, or thieving assistants to older persons. They are about to be jailed for their crimes. Society did not seem to find any way to reform them. But how else could they eat? How else could they survive with a semblance of freedom? Their clothing, all in complete rags, still kept them warmer than nakedness. Note that even such young miscreants try to cling to typical fashion by wearing coats, vests, and even cravats above worn-out, torn, and threadbare trousers or breeches. One has a cap. Two of them are barefoot. The smallest boy is wearing an unidentifiable rag in lieu of a coat to hold in a fragment of warmth. His shoes are many sizes too large, but at least his feet are covered.",

Curls fall over her shoulders onto her bodice. White stockings and flat black shoes are greatly exaggerated as elegantly (and inhumanly) small. Grandmother Anna has a perfectly smooth, white, neck shawl pinned over the shoulders of her black, fullskirted dress. In folk-art style, her head is over-large, with a very meager day cap. One foot showing is the size of a finger. This painting has a faux frame painted around the edge of the stretched canvas.",

Neckerchiefs were much used to cover the mouth and nose during dust-storms and the dust kicked up by moving cattle.Denim jeans, invented by Levi Strauss forGold Rush miners were favorite trousers because they were tough fabric, double-stitched, and reinforced at all stress points with metal rivets.  Over the jeans,they often wore leather chaps, which protected their legs from wild growth, as they rode and worked.One man here has gloves, though all would have used them, and a few have guns for shooting at preditors of four and two legs. Most cowboyssmoked.Hats were wide and flat-brimmed to block harsh sunlight but were bent into any shapethe men wanted. They wore “cowboy boots”with pointed toes to slip easily into stirrups, and heels to keep the boots from sliding too far forwardMany wore mustaches, but beards were too hot in the summer sun.Cowboys are still needed today, are just as rugged, and dress pretty much the same way.",

Her shoes are flats, not boots because they had only their fashionable shoes left to wear when sturdier shoes wore out. She has a wide straw hat to shade her from the sun as she pulls her load of possessions. Her toddler is riding on top of the load while another woman pushes the cart from behind.  Canvas covers over their goods were sometimes used as tents overnight in bad weather.Behind her,a man pulls his own handcart as he enthusiastically waves to the people along the way. He wears high boots and a long-sleeved shirt, probably wool.  He has a long British mustache.  Other families walk along beside them carrying babies and leading little children as young as 5 and 6 years old.  Very small children actually walked all the way to the Rocky Mountains, as recorded in reminiscences. According to some pioneer diaries, many people in larger populations called out ridicule atthe travelers as they passed.",

The ring on his finger belonged to his father, and his suit --from whatever source--is too wide for him; the lapels reach almost to his shoulders. The dark vest is double-breasted. His hair appears to have been chopped off in the most economical way.       After his father was assassinated, Joseph F. walked to Utah with his mother and little sister.  President Brigham Young decided to send Joseph F. on a mission (without purse or scrip), announcing his calling in General Conference. Glad to go, but all alone, Joseph worked in San Francisco to earn passage.  During his first year in the Islands,he didn't know the language and nearly starved, but was taken in by a big, kind, \"Hawaiian Mama\" who nursedhim to health.After learning Hawaiian and serving successfully for 4 years, Joseph simply made his return, grown into a man, with a strong testimony and a powerful drive to be well educated. In 1866 he became an apostle. In 1890 he was called assixth President and Prophet of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.",

With a poetic bent, he wrote words for several hymns; and more pamphlets than any other Church member to explain Church of Jesus Christ LDS beliefs.

He felt too old and weak for the calling, but the Lord assured him in a remarkable vision in the Salt Lake City Temple, that he could do the work for a short time. Greatly loved for his gentle faithfulness, he led the widely spreading church for three years until his death in 1901.

The vest is of figured satin. His curly hair is cut to the ear lobes. An actor in many kinds of roles in the Salt Lake Theater, Maiben was much applauded by lovers of drama and comedy. Like others in the early theater, he also built sets, painted scenery, and helped in all parts of the background production. Occasionally, his wife, the beautiful Flora Louise Maddison, took parts on stage as well, even while producing twelve children. Flora, a convert who had been raised with servants of the British royal family, was a woman of much refinement and good education. She was well-received as a sometimes-actress. She wears pearl earrings and necklace in an early portrait.",

    "description": "Though all seem weary of this long photo-sitting, they display very fine middle-class clothing. Mother’s ensemble includes an ornate lace collar and large oval broach. Sleeves of a different fabric show under a darker overblouse with ribbons. We see her gold watch, two gold finger rings, and bright earrings. Her hair has been swept back and up from a center part in stand-out loops above her ears. She may have deliberate “rats” beneath to hold that shape, though the rest of her hair hangs down straight in back. One outstanding feature of this family image is that both children wear large, shiny belt buckles. The little boy’s hair is swept up into a large curl on top, and his ornate jacket has dark buttons and trim that let his white shirt sleeve show through from elbow to wrist. His shirt has ruffles down the front. The little girl has lacy ruffles on her bodice-front and sleeves and a velvet skirt. Father’s clothing is unremarkable, but his hair is puffed out at ear-length, and his beard and mustache are thick and dark.",

Dark buttons close the front bodice below a lace piece crossed at the neckline. Her hair has a wide black velvet ribbon bow on top, perhaps attached to some type of clip or snood. Father Julius wears checked trousers with a dark coat, figured all over. His boots have square toes. A mustache and clipped chin beard expose his collar and bow tie. His hair is cut short. The toddler boy on his lap sits in a dress with a frill around the yoke and a high neck. His ankle-high shoes are laced and tied. Their daughter wears a silk dress with a bodice draping up to bows on the shoulders and ruffles descending from the bows. Sleeves are short and straight. Her hair is pulled back with a headband. A standing brother has a jacket of medium wool with black tape bordering all edges. We see a bit of a white shirt collar and cuff. His trousers are ample length, and his hair has a neat side parting.",

His tie of figured silk is in a horizontal square knot, with a high collar folded down over it. In mid-life, Heber’s hair was dark but rapidly balding. His sideburns are longer, as was the fashion. Christeen wears a shirred bodice that gathers to the center front above her large skirt of striped fabric. Her raised bust line shows she is obviously wearing a corset, as was usual with women of social status. She has a white insert at the neckline and a gold chain. Lacy engageants are narrow from the elbow to the wrist beneath bell sleeves. Her long hair is parted in the center with braids wrapped back and forth across the crown of her head. Little Cornelia has a simple dress with pleats across the bodice in enfant style. Her naturally curly hair is parted in the center. This little daughter died at four years of age.",

The red-haired baby has pale blue ribbons on her white batiste dress. Four months from the time of this painting, the baby girl died. Carved, background paneling is a figment of the artist's imagination to add dignity to the sitters. The Pratts were not as wealthy as the painting seems to indicate but they had very fine taste and education.",

Many layers of skirts, overskirts, or flounces were admired. The more decoration one could afford, the better to show wealth. Hairpieces of curls, flowers, feathers, and ribbons were popular.

The sleeves are fitted smoothly at the slightly-dropped shoulder but are moderately gathered at the narrow cuffs. The high round neckline has a frayed edging but was probably worn with a collar of plain fabric or lace over the top.

Then he spun the wool rolags (carded wool hanks) into threads for the loom, took extra effort to string the loom, and wove the plaid yardage. The fabric was carefully steam pressed to help smooth and shrink the fabric before cutting it The husband then cut out the dress pieces and hand sewed all parts of the bodice and lining together. Tiny buttons were applied to ribbon designs down the double-tucked bodice front. These were very expensive brass buttons made in the design of a slightly flattened, hollow, cone shape with a shank for sewing on.",

Deep pleats on each side of the front buttons give a shawl-like effect and disguise her aging, flat figure. She seems comfortabe not wearing a corset but still looking her best. It appears that the gathering of the skirt is made with cartridge pleating, with probably more fullness in folds of the center back. Her small day cap has cheeky ruffles and a checkered ribbon to tie under the chin. Her hands are covered with necessary gloves which disguise many years of hard work colonizing wilderness land. We see no other jewelry on her. The hem of her dress may have silk tape on the hemline also. Rebecca Burlend - (1793–1872) wrote A True Picture of Emigration with her husband.",

A black velvet binding of emphasizes the hem. A very broad straw hat is an elegant pewter color with a large white flower and leaves on the hatband. Though hats of the 1850s and 60s tended to grow smaller as skirts grew wider, a woman exposed to sunlight would wear a broad-brimmed hat to protect her complexion. The model carries fresh magenta flowers in a fashion show. Her hair would most certainly NOT be worn down as shown. It would be center-parted and drawn back into a bun, twist or chignon, perhaps with side ringlets. At night hair was braided to keep it in order. Only little girls wore their hair down. It was a mark of womanhood to “put up your hair,” all the way into the 20th century. See authentic hairstyles in the HAIR AND BONNETsection below.",

It is a special golden brocade silk gown with golden silk fringe on the lower edges of double bell-shaped sleeves and on the border of a capelet which meets in the front, its horizontal border of fringe falling over the bodice and tops of the sleeves. This dress only uses fringe for trimming, which calls attention to the heavy and beautiful brocade fabric, all within a limited color range for impact. It is notable that the Utah Governor's mansion was restored to this period of 1850s to 1870s, the pioneer years, with much furniture and drapery employing heavy fringes, tassels, and heavier fabrics of the era.",

Many years later, when her daughter was married, she took part of the enormous skirt fabric and made these wide flared sleeves to change the original narrow style of the first sleeves. The bodice is fully lined because the fabric is translucent. Top-stitching holds the neckline and arms-eyes in place. The top of the sleeve is a flat semi-circle above the gathering of the lower portion. The skirt was large enough to go over many petticoats. The center bodice, with princess lines, is gathered at the bottom into a belt-like insertion. If the daughter’s dress was made to look antique in style, there may have been engageants worn under these wide sleeves,",

Just showing above the collar is a sheer, embroidered, wide-necked chemise. Flowers were often pinned to the center front of the bride's neckline -- artificial sweet peas cascade almost to her waist. The very deep, narrow, V-shaped, waist point is likely held in place with a busk. Unpressed pleats flare her white silk skirt under more lace. The sleeves are unseen beneath the generous shoulder flounces, though their delicate lace shows below. She is wearing round, pearl earrings, and only a simple bracelet as she holds fresh flowers in her gloveless hands. The bride’s glossy hair is center-parted, then rolled back into two full puffs above her ears. Her back hair would be an elegant twist. Less wealthy brides wore gowns of colors and prints that could be worn as “best dresses” after the wedding.",

Tiny, unseen, fabric belt ends are sewn into the inner side seams and pinned comfortably across the stomach beneath the full front. Thus, the front fabric falls straight from shoulder to hem to ease maternal expansion, but the dress back shows the small waistline. The dress is of a charming petal design in pastels, spread across the semi-sheer yardage. A larger flower print borders the double sleeve ruffles and is in vertical rows on both sides of the center-front opening. A placket lies beneath the front opening for putting the dress on and off. At the neckline is a four-inch deep, embroidered white lawn collar and a small broach. The sleeves flow from a gathered shoulder seam to fall in a bell shape. The double ruffles at the sleeve bottoms frame an inset of white lace as a third ruffle.",

Black silk braid trims the edge of her short caplets over the sleeves and is likely around the neck or front opening of the bodice. She is sitting down in a corset which would make a fine silhouette when standing, but, when seated, pushes up the bust into an unnatural shelf. Her fashionable, batiste day cap has double shirring beside the cheeks on the front and back of a black ribbon. Luxuriously wide, black, silk ribbons tie it on. The common hairstyle was a middle part that smoothly drapes back her shiny brown hair and swings it up into a back bun. Her left hand is set on the edge of a table at the photographer's studio beside an open book. This woman of goodly means and advanced education is thought to be Leonora Cannon Taylor (source of image lost). If so, she came to Toronto, Canada in the early 1850s as a companion to a wealthy traveler friend. Leonora, originally from the British Isle of Man, met John Taylor in the Vancouver Methodist church. A widower, John married her. Very soon Church of Jesus Christ LDS missionaries baptized them both. Taylor, in later years, became the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.",

This silk dress bodice for a teenage girl is entirely hand sewn by amazingly tiny hand stitches, observable with slightly off-color thread. The gathering of the skirt is an excellent example of “cartridge pleating”, in which several rows of short in-and-out stitches are gathered together to make “cartridge” shaped pleats that extend down onto the skirt 1 or 2 inches. This dress view also shows quarter-inch self-piping around the waistline where the bodice and skirt meet in a V-shape. Cartridge pleats are more slimming over the hips than regular gathering, as the pleats can be formed to be as narrow as the hips are for that extra two inches. Regular gathering bursts out directly from the waist seam and emphasizes hip-width.",

The model holds a corset, which she will put on over her chemise. Since the shoulders were bare and bras had not yet been invented, the corset supported her breasts, as seen below. Over her corset, she will add petticoats, and perhaps a hooped-skirt. Her ruffled pantalets descend below the chemise almost to the ankles. Bottom ruffles are embellished with tucks and lace. The pantalets have two separate legs and are open at the crotch to facilitate body functions while the hands and arms are free to hold the gown and petticoats aside. She also wears white silk stockings. For menstrual needs, women wore cloth pads against the body, held in place by cloth bands. Before toilet paper was invented in 1857, most western people used corncobs, grass, leaves or dirt. Some of the wealthy may have afforded washable rags. (Google)",

    "description": "This corset was made specifically for a certain woman's body measurements. The fabric could be washable cotton or linen on the inside and satin-weave cotton on the outside for a woman of some means. This would not always be white, as some women ordered a cheerful print or favorite color of fabric. Laces in back were adjusted by a friend or maid, then the woman could fasten herself in front. Flexible stiffness is added in casings of fabric all around that contain insertions of “whalebone” (baleen--the long, thin straining \"teeth\" of a whale's mouth). Baleen was long-lasting and helped ensure a small waist over full hips, with erectness in front to prevent wrinkles. Exaggerated hips were sewn to flare outward, thus further emphasizing the small waistline. In the early 1800s, corsets flared up and out from the waist to support but not cover the breasts, allowing for a deep décolletage and breasts swelling above a low neckline (much seen in Regency clothing). Later, breasts were covered, allowing for padding over small bosoms. Even today, research shows that a wide ratio of bust & hip to waistline is especially attractive to men -- thus the unhealthy 1800s crushing of waist and ribs. Breathing and eating were difficult, causing a lot of “feminine fainting,” and damage to internal organs.” (But who ever claimed fashion was intelligent?)",

    "description": "Throughout the 1800s, the most common item of underclothing was a chemise, a sort of slip that reached from shoulder to calf, and might have sleeves, depending on the weather. For the poor, a chemise had no ornamentation other than a drawstring at the top and was often used as a nightgown, as well. The wealthy decorated it with tucks and lace. The top might be cut closer to the neck, or dropped over the shoulder, as here. Women who could afford them also wore pantalets, leg coverings for each leg, attached to each other only at the waistline front and back, with buttons or ties. This left the crotch open for toilet functions, and a woman’s hands free to lift the extensive petticoats and crinolines. (They wore cloth bands and folded cloths for menstruation.) The hem of the pantalet could be ruffled with lace and embroidery as at left.",

Rose fabric was not long enough, so a band of green was added to the inner length. DESCRIPTION: A pretty petticoat may not be seen, but adds to the pleasure of the wearer. A padded and quilted petticoat gave warmth and fullness, as seen in color images from an early Utah settlement. A rose outer fabric is padded with stretched and thinned \"rolags,\" of the carded wool. A green, printed cotton as a partial inside lining increases the durability of the garment. It is more broadly padded from the lower half to the hem from wool that was carded to smooth the fibers. The structure requires a strong cotton fabric waistband with a handy metal button. The bottom edge is bound in woven black woolen tapes and narrow strips of cloth. Only small anchoring stitches keep the fibers carefully in place; it is not closely quilted. The curator at the Museum in Fairview, Utah, wondered if it could have been padded with alpaca fibers rather than Utah's ordinary 2 or 3 kinds of sheep wool. Carma doubted alpaca use, since NO alpacas came with early pioneers, and were unknown in Utah until recently.",

Gold quilting thread was used, and a 3/4 inch metal button at the waist. It was fashioned out of various widths of fabric sewn together to make an A-line shape and then the top was pleated only a little onto the waistband fabric, which was light brown and white woven cotton. To make the petticoat stiffer in its 31-inch length, the upper section shows diagonal quilting lines all on a slant with less cotton or wool padding near the waistline. The lower-center band of quilting has multiple \"seashells\" or \"clouds,\" while the bottom has horizontal stitching in 6 bands, 1 inch wide, to hold the petticoat (and thus the dress) out more fully. This quilting pattern shows the artistry of a highly experienced seamstress, who bound the hemline with 1-inch wide velvet of dark brown or originally black. It is a similar quilting pattern to the glazed rose cotton petticoat above.",

When it wasn’t being worn, the hoop could collapse into a flat circle for storage. Usually, petticoats were worn over the hoops to smooth the surface of the skirt. In the 60s, hoops became enormously wide, shown in many parody illustrations of hoops seven ft. in diameter, requiring that a dress be lowered over the upper body by two maids on stools with longs sticks and pulleys (shown in 1860s fashion.)",

So most women wore shawls for warmth that would spread over their skirts as far down as they wished. This lace-like shawl was made for beauty, probably by Thomas’s wife Elizabeth.",

Brown prints are seen in the front bodice, with tiny shell buttons. The skirt is of squares and made long enough to shorten or lengthen with a tuck. Of almost fifty different prints and weaves, a few squares of bright yellow and orange match an orange binding around the waistline. The skirt was sewn onto the bodice after the bodice edge was piped. The most worn-out tell their own story of children's arms being thrust into old, fragile fabrics. Some tearing was inevitable and beyond mending. This dress made by necessity was saved for a keepsake to remember the children who wore it. The compacted history of each of these fabrics is especially important, as each bit of cloth showed its last artful use. The variety of colors and designs makes it a supreme accomplishment of devoted LDS-American folk artists.",

    "description": "In this Damaged daguerreotype image we see the first triplets born in Utah Territory to T. Rhoades and Mary White. Though darkened around the edges, the baby dresses are sufficiently clear to get an idea of style. In the center is Benjamin with his sisters Adeline and Adelaide on each side. All three of the baby dresses are made of a medium-color tiny print. Light bands of trim perk up the longish skirts and caplet sleeve tops over three- quarter length sleeves. There is some sort of narrow shawl or folded blanket hanging across the body of Adelaide on the right. Benjamin died at age three while the sisters lived into adulthood. Their mother, Mary Miranda White Rhoades is not clearly seen due to the staining, though she appears to be smiling.",

There were fewer parental restrictions in this well-off land. Poor children could \"quit their parents\" at any time they chose."

The mother could add a ring of matching fabric and more buttons around the waist as the boy grew. Or a long, tucked-in top could provide growing room. All the mother need do was lower the row of buttons to fit a taller boy, or raise the buttons for a little brother. This standard-design of suit with collar and cuffs was reproduced by Carma for the Lyon Drug and Mercantile store in Nauvoo.

Her dress has satin flanges from shoulder to waist, and two sets of alternating wool and satin cap sleeves. Long, gathered sleeves below the caps end in short wrist cuffs. Her full skirt is softly pleated. Wide satin ribbons gather into large bows draping from in her back hair. But the loveliest clothing never mutes the pain of a loved one's death.",

The handbag is a miniature Berlin needlework piece, and her broad felt hat is decorated with a white plume and a dark bow under her chin. Beneath the dress is undoubtedly correct underwear. Miniature furniture is accurate in the smallest ways. Fashion dolls were popular for showing women the details of the latest fashions, created in miniature.",

The modern reproduction shirts here have fuller sleeves, gathered at shoulder and cuff, which is wider than daguerreotypes of actual shirts of the decade. Men aspiring to any fashion at all wore vests over their shirts, as the bare shirt often doubled as a night shirt, and was, therefore, “underwear.” Suspenders of all kinds held up trousers, which were now uniformly front buttoned under a fly– no more broadfall trousers, and no zippers yet. A scarf tied around the neck under the collar was standard, and men always wore hats out-of-doors. The hat top left is called a “pilot cap.”",

One year older than Joseph Smith, Bridger became a hunter, trapper, trader, Indian fighter, and guide who preceded Brigham Young across the plains by many years. He was one of the first white explorers to see the Great Salt Lake. As the Church of Jesus Christ LDS members began their westward trek, Bridger met Brigham Young and discussed the Salt Lake Valley. Drawing a very accurate map on the ground for President Young, Bridger none-the-less expressed severe doubts that Salt Lake Valley could support agriculture at all.",

Her 1860s dress of silk satin has a lace collar and a front placket that opens with small buttons. Her sleeves are roomy and have ornamentation sewn at the tops. She carries a handkerchief and her earrings are simple globe droplets. Jane joined the Church of Jesus Christ LDS in Connecticut. After spreading the gospel to many other mostly black converts, she led a group of family and friends westward to gather with the Prophet Joseph Smith in Nauvoo, Illinois. The last half (400 miles) of their journey was made on foot because half of them could not afford train fare. Many arrived with worn-out shoes. Jane’s trunk of clothing was lost or stolen along the way. After her friends found immediate jobs in Nauvoo to work in Church homes, the young Jane Manning lived with the Joseph Smith Jr. family as a \"daughter\" and helped Emma Smith with her home and hotel labors. She married another black Latterday Saint, Isaac James. After traveling west with the Church, a daughter, Mary Ann, was born to Jane in May 1848—the first black child born in Utah. Despite daunting hardships, Jane was a great missionary and an exemplary Christian all her life.",

He accepted the teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith in Nauvoo just before Joseph was martyred. On missions to preach the gospel in 1852, Van Cott went to England, and later to Scandinavia, twice as Mission President. He became very influential with the Scandinavians, who were joining the Church in thousands in the last half of the Century. He retired to Sanpete County, Utah, among the numerous Scandinavians there, enjoyed their neat and thrifty ways of farming, and tried to perfect his Danish language skills with them.

    "description": "Joseph F. Smith is shown as an LDS apostle at age 27, wearing a suit with a matching coat, vest, and trousers. His coat has a velvet collar above regular fabric lapels, called a “Chesterfield.” The sleeves are long and comfortable but narrow down to his wrists. He wears a double-breasted vest with a wide shawl collar and fabric-covered buttons. His shirt likely has tucks down the front which we cannot see, but the collar is partially folded over a dark, square knot tie. In the new mode of suit, the vest, coat, and trousers were made of the same fabric, which unity had not been seen in earlier decades. His face is clean-shaven with hair parted on one side and combed straight back. Joseph was the nephew of Prophet Joseph Smith, and son of Patriarch Hyrum Smith, both of whom were assassinated in the boy’s youth. After walking to Utah Territory with his mother and siblings, Joseph was left an orphan at the death of his mother when he was 13. At 15 he was sent to the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii) as a missionary, earning his transportation as a dock worker in California. At age 22 he served a Church mission to Great Britain. Later, after serving seven terms in the Utah territorial House of Representatives, Smith became the newest President and Prophet of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1901. He died of pneumonia in 1918.",

    "description": "A coat with a velvet collar is called a “Chesterfield.” Classically, it was knee length. Still striking and popular into the 21st century, a Chesterfield coat may be of various lengths on men and women. Snow's hair is conveniently short and has no sideburns. On his shirt is a jeweled button at the collar, but we see no tie in this portrait. What vest we can see has a long opening at the bosom. The sleeves of his coat are very roomy, and, at this date, still, no padding was used on the shoulders. An LDS Apostle, Snow spent most of his life leading the Church of Jesus Christ LDS in the burning hot desert summers of southern St. George, Utah. Apostles traveled around the Utah territory conducting meetings and official actions for the Saints. Snow loved his people in their efforts to farm and build up the South of Utah. A bronze bust of him stands in a prominent place in the gardens of the St. George Tabernacle.",

His double-breasted vest has a simple notched collar and is draped with a gold chain holding his pocket watch lower down. Note that Heber's coat (not vest) has an Mcut lapel, very fashionable during that era. An intelligent and energetic man, Heber was in the habit of being clean-shaven on the lip, cheek, and chin, with neatly clipped sideburns reaching down to become “muttonchops” below his chinline. We have no pictures from younger years when Heber was a maker of common, \"red pottery\" items for ordinary people. But a few from his later life show him as a vigorous and persuasive missionary and Apostle for the Church of Jesus Christ LDS.",

The lapels of this coat can button up to the throat in extreme cold but seldom do. All edges of the opening and cuffs are bound with heavy silk tape of a lighter tone. His dark Chesterfield collar is silk velvet and the cravat ties in a large knot of silk. He holds a light-colored glove.

Lined with silk in the body, or cambric in printed colors in the sleeves, it could be as short as the knees in the earlier 1800s but later was usually to the calf with the coat skirt attached to the fitted waistline. A full lining would be in any wool coat, but linen coats for summer had little lining. The center-back vent is slit to the waist. Strong muslin pockets hang inside at the waistline seam with outside flaps. In the back, the right side laps over the left about two inches. A high slit in the coat skirt is good when riding a horse or driving a team from a wooden seat. A welt pocket is on the left breast. Sometimes there were deep interior breast pockets for documents. Sleeves are cut in two pieces, upper and lower portions, so they fit very well. Buttons were of metal or bone.",

A wide red belt is over rather full Turkish trousers, which appeared in certain chosen colors of white, red. blue or very dark red. Gaiters of canvas reached from upper calves to their last button at the ankles to gaiters made which partially cover his shoes. He wears a haversack over one shoulder, with his bedroll on the floor.

Uniforms of his day very often had stand-up collars, as begun in the 1700s. His coat and trousers are of heavy navy wool, but the greatest cost in his uniform was his many gold buttons and other ornamentation. He only wore this most formal uniform for special and official occasions. Kane helped the Church of Jesus Christ LDS members politically and defensively in their mid-west history. He was very concerned about the host of illegalities forced upon innocent Church members, eventually watching mobs drive them out of their beautiful city of Nauvoo, Illinois/ Brigham Young very much depended upon Kane during their western exodus from the United States. Kane was instrumental in financially aiding the Church of Jesus Christ LDS by seeing to the recruitment of 500 men for the Mormon Battalion in the short-lived Spanish American War. The Church of Jesus Christ LDS volunteers received cash payments, most of which helped the Saints purchase muchneeded supplies and provided transportation for several hundred families to the Salt Lake Valley.",

A little wasted cloth to make the sleeve fit better was not a great loss as the textile industry progressed in the later 1800s. The lower front below the breastbone, is attached as a separate piece. It is cut wider and gathered to accommodate fuller girth, as is the out-curving cut of the lower side seams. As usual with better shirts, it has only a collar band to receive a stiffened and ironed collar which will be buttoned on.",

Such mills went some way to making Church members self-sustainable, both in using Utah wool and employing their own teens to attend to mill machinery. When Utah connected to wider world markets, better woolens became available. Eventually, the mills in Utah closed down, and the buildings were used for other purposes.",

The trousers have a buttoned, center front opening, which became the fashion in 1848 and onward. The vest has small checks, probably a fine wool. Under his soft, turned-down collar, a small, fringed, neckerchief is tied in a knot. Sort, uneven hair is combed straight back. Square-toed boots are unpolished, indicating a working man on dusty roads. Sarah‘s dress is white and dark plaid silk with a white belt at the natural waist. Black velvet ribbons lie in 2 diagonal stripes over her shoulders, with more of the ribbon making designs on the outsides of her sleeves down to wide white cuffs. Velvet covered buttons on the center front are below a matching, flat, velvet, ribbon bow at the neckline. Her collar is narrow and white. Sarah’s waved hair is caught neatly behind her head in a black, silk, chenille snood. Her only jewelry is a pair of round droplet earrings. John Henry did far-reaching missionary work and was later called as a Church Apostle by President John Taylor. He became a counselor in the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ LDS.

Webster is the man who famously stopped a Sunday school teacher from criticizing Church authorities who allowed the Martin and Willey hand-carters to start out across the plains too late in the season, resulting in many casualties and deaths.

Francis and Betsy were grateful, with so many others, for the chance to grow deeply intimate with their God during the hard journey. Though expecting a baby, Betsy and Francis sold their wagon, using the proceeds to buy handcarts for destitute pioneers to travel with them to Utah.",

    "description": "Henry Maiben, a talented actor and comedian in the old Salt Lake Theater of the late 1800s, and his wife Flora Louise Maddison, an occasional actress. In this image, Henry wears fashionable clothing representing a role for the late 1830s with a horizontal satin tie, a padded-up collar in back, and gathers at the top of his sleeves. The vest is of figured satin. His curly hair is cut to the ear lobes. Acting in many kinds of parts, Maiben was much applauded by lovers of drama and comedy. Like others in the early theater, he also built sets, painted scenery, and helped in all phases of the background production. Occasionally, his wife, the beautiful Flora Louise Maddison, took parts on stage as well, even while producing twelve children. Flora, a convert who had been raised with servants who worked for the British royal family, was a woman of much refinement and good education. Here, she wears pearl earrings and necklace. Her hair is center-parted and pulled back into a high bun on the back of her head.",

It is a one-piece top with faux lapels and vest sewn together and worn over a white blouse. It has real sleeves and cuffs and appears to have engageants, which might also be sewn into the bodice. The black ribbon-tie under the collar is real. A coat and vest worn over a tiny waist and swelling bust such as this model has would gap apart to flop around in all directions. Thus, we know it is trompe l'oeil. The skirt is green with wide plaid bands and black velvet ribbons in three rows. The plaid fabric is echoed on the lapels and cuffs of the bodice. The skirt is not illustrated as wide as many skirts of the 1860s, so it may be a day dress. The cap is of sheer ruffles with flower embellishments over her center-parted, waving side hair. She wears yellow gloves the color of her faux vest. Such wide skirts had to be sewn in several A-line panels, as a straight stretch of fabric would be too long at the top to gather into a tiny waistline.",

    "description": "A pretty, three-piece day-dress can be worn indoors or outdoors. The bolero-style jacket is from the Civil War era. Zouaves were actually Moroccan volunteer units from the French Foreign Legion. Considered daredevils, they caught the attention of America just before the American Civil War broke out. American soldiers copied the style, and women’s fashion mimicked the soldiers. The woman's version is basically an altered bolero with popular pagoda sleeves. It is basically a short fitted jacket worn open and usually seen with a complimentary or contrasting skirt and blouse. This jacket is undecorated but can sport added cord trim in black. See Zouave uniforms online for many ideas of cording designs. The blouse, sold separately, has a Chinese collar, front buttons, and long sleeves gathered at the wrist with elastic – which would have been authentic in the 1860s. She has a broach at the neck of the jacket. Her belt is brown leather with studs, not included in the purchase. The skirt is a cotton plaid fabric with an inset of cotton fabric matching the jacket, 3/4 down the skirt. The skirt and jacket can be purchased as a set or separately from the Etsy link at top. $125 · The lower-classes of 1860s might try to ape the latest fashions, but in inferior fabrics and constructions, and much less decoration. Poor-class women would probably not wear crinoline hoops. Their clothing, bought 2nd or 3rd hand, would lag behind current fashions.",

The bonnet would be worn outdoors but removed indoors. The woman in red has skirt trims of black ruffles and braid with bows, duplicated on her pagoda sleeves.

The skirt is very full and seems to be both flared and pleated from the waistline. She wears crinolines and petticoats to maintain the smooth, cup-shape of the skirt. But the most striking element of the dress is the profusion of design added in long strings of beads over all the seams, and carefully sewn to the dress fabric (silk) in chains and curlicue designs on the skirt and sleeves. The beads stand out three-dimensionally to attract the eye. Triple strings of beads drape over her bustline and her upper arms. There is even a chain for her hidden pocket watch. Her center-parted hair hangs below her ears in ringlets, which may continue around to the back; or the back hair may be in a bun or twist.",

Short, puffed sleeves gather at the top and the bottom, with a dark trim outlining the bottom gather, a short ruffle extending below. The fabric of her dress is figured and shows clearly on her sleeves. A sheer overskirt covers the skirt so the pattern is vague. Below the hem of the overskirt is a ruffle with black edging above the last 3 inches of the skirt. She wears a crinoline beneath or fullness. The girl wears bracelets on both arms.

Beautifully made, not in mourning crepe but apparently thicker alpaca wool, it would be delightfully soft to the touch. The fabric may be dark gray or black threads interwoven with gray. The bodice has a natural waistline with a slight dip center front. Four diagonal pleats rise from each side of the center front opening (probably fastened with many hooks). The wide sleeves have soft pleats at the dropped shoulders and are pleated into narrow cuffs. The woman is also wearing a black lace and silk mourning cap with an emphasis of ruffling against the cheeks. It is tied with black silk ribbons that have shiny edges. She holds a small book, possibly a prayer book from her church, or an album of sympathy cards from friends who mourn with her. It took appreciable wealth to afford visiting cards bearing an image of the owner, as the rest of her clothing attests. Well-to-do friends and guests traded such cards around and collected them in albums (see Wikipedia).",

Pauline was a famous Austrian socialite, mainly active in Vienna and Paris. Stunning as a bride (see Wikipedia), she was known for her great charm and elegance as well as for her international social life. She was an important promoter of the work of the German composer Richard Wagner and the Czech composer Smetana, as well as several artists and writers of the times. She knew all the great and famous throughout Europe and was instrumental in the creation of the haute couture industry.

Fabrics range from solids to plaids to flamboyant prints with a multitude of trim treatments. It is certain that these dresses would be handed down to little sisters and re-used, if not totally re-made. Hair is always center-parted but then falls in ringlets, braids, twists, and pinned-up side curls. None of them wear visible jewelry. Many of these girls grew up with abundant music lessons and chances for public speaking, acting, and ballet dancing on the stages of Salt Lake Theatrical sites.

    "description": "Susa\" [Susan Amelia] Young, daughter of Brigham Young, made this actual dress for her sixteenth birthday and her marriage on that day to Jacob F. Gates. It was a three-tiered style that Susa preferred, although it was less popular by 1869. It avoids petticoats and more fullness because it was in a time of narrowing skirts toward the 1870s. Although Queen Victoria started the fashion of white wedding dresses in 1840 Great Britain, wedding dresses among the common people in America were rarely white, as the bride intended to get good use out of this best dress in her future. Susa emphasized her bodice seams and flounce edges with narrow black velvet ribbons. A fringe decorates the bottom of the bodice and the upper arms -- probably recycled from someone else in the Young family. Sleeves are full and gathered from upper arms to wrists. She wears white lace gloves. Susa chose a flowery fabric with pink and turquoise figures in it, which have faded in the past 150 years to general beige tones. The tiers were sewn to a cone-shaped base made of the ugliest fabric in the Brigham Young Family Store, which economy must have pleased the Prophet, who encouraged economy in everything. The model's hairstyle is in curls down her back (it would have been ringlets, if authentic). The bonnet was small, with tiny rosebuds over and under the brim, and a pink lace bow beneath one ear. Fashion, in general, paired large skirts with small bonnets, and narrow skirts with larger bonnets.",

    "description": "Eliza R. Snow wears a bodice with vertical velvet ribbons down both sides of center buttons, as well as attached to her upper sleeves. Black lace capsleeves with ornate edges extend from the sleeve seam over the ribbons. The full lower sleeves are gathered just above the wrists with black lace ruffles. Small, white engageants show at the wrist next to black, spotted-lace, fingerless gloves. Her belt is probably a stiffened backing covered with velvet and is clasped with a vertical, oblong buckle. A gold chain drops past her waistline and tucks between the pleats of her skirt. It likely holds a flattened pocket watch to put in a tiny skirt pocket. Eliza’s white collar is embroidered with scalloped edges and has a broach in the center front. She wears a lace cap or snood over the crown and back of her head, with a top-center bow. Hair is center-parted, waves down the sides, and is collected in a back arrangement, possibly a snood. Note her long, droplet earrings. Eliza was a strong and brilliant woman, an acclaimed and published poetess, and 2nd General President of the Women’s Relief Society. A sister of Church President Lorenzo Snow, she had met and received autographs from Queen Victoria of England, Victor Hugo, Susan B. Anthony, and President Abraham Lincoln.",

    "description": "Hannah Tapfield King is very well-turned-out in a day dress with wide front bands of black silk ornamented with white clovers. They add interest down the bodice and in a large front section of the skirt. Ruffles of the same fabric outline the skirt panel. Sleeves of solid-color silk begin at her low-shoulder with wide pleats down to small pleats at narrow wrist cuffs. Very obvious is a hexagonal belt buckle with a perforated design inside its rim. Her hair has side curls in rolls, one of which sits forward over her cheeks on each side. Much of her hairstyle is indistinct due to a full-hair snood which covers the style from forehead to back neck. A side hair ornament, possibly of metal, keeps the snood and curls in place. Growing up in Cambridgeshire, England, Hannah found it difficult to draw close to women who were not as well educated as she, or could not match her own level of creative expression in writing. Her talents found full range in Salt Lake City, Utah, where she contributed much to the Woman's Exponent and intellectual organizations. She became one of the general directors of local Relief Societies throughout Utah territory. Though she bore ten children in wealth with her husband, Thomas Owen King, only four children lived to maturity",

Carma made herself this bonnet from a royal blue straw hat, retaining only part of the brim. The gold bavolet ruffle at the neck is a soft, delustered satin. The same fabric lines the inside brim of the bonnet, shirred from the edge to the crown. The border of the brim displays a repeated design of pleated blue ribbons, with identical ribbons spaced twice on the center part of the crown and around the edge of the crown. At the base of each pleated ribbon is cording of the gold fabric. On each side of the bonnet are white flowers tinged with gold and brown. They are placed at the point where sheer ribbons tie the bonnet under the chin. The sheer ribbons also form rosettes toward the side-back of the bonnet. Red-haired Carma wears it with a blue, quality-calico dress of printed tiny white flowers. Fingerless white crocheted lace gloves are worn with this, but not shown.",

In the 1860s, plus before and after, women liked to wear wide-brimmed, decorated sun hats. They ornamentation it with all kinds of flowers, netting, ribbons, feathers, and other pretty things.

They were two separate legs held together at the waistline with a band or fastening. They may have been attached together a few inches farther down, as well, but they had to be open at the lower crotch. Because a woman wore at lease a chemise, corset, and tight-fitting dress on her upper torso, and many petticoats, hoops, and sometimes padding – ALL underneath her outer skirt-- toilet functions required both of a woman’s hands to hold her lower clothing aside from the body, toilet, or commode as she sat. Thus a split crotch was quite necessary under the circumstances. Sometimes a split crotch was made with overlapping flaps to hide the split. With long skirts of many layers, privacy was pretty much ensured.",

    "description": "A most important item of underwear for women of the 1860s was the hoop skirt or crinoline. Although they had been introduced a decade earlier, the 1860s were the hay-day of hoopery! Women of all classes wore them as they could afford to. Many construction materials had been tried to support this exaggerated fullness of skirts (sometimes up to 6 ft across!). First: multiple petticoats of stiff, horsehair fabric were tried but were too heavy. Also whalebone (often fragile), and brass wire (ridgid), with, finally, thin strips of flexible steel covered in fabric padding. The steel rings did not extend over the stomach front but ended at the side hips. This allowed a girl to sit down without the hoops flying up over her head. As she sat, she gracefully gathered the lower back hoops up and under her knees. (What price beauty?) This illustration shows the half-girl in her bedroom (right) with a hoopskirt over her chemise and corset. Over that she wore one to three petticoats to prevent the steel hoops from pressing through her gown. On left she is in public, dressed here in a multi-tiered skirt, shawl, and bonnet, and carrying a parasol.",

This American day cap basket is made of fine split reeds and is woven only deep enough to prevent one or a few caps from being wrinkled. One very sheer cap is within. The basket has two looped, reed rings for slipping over a wrist. Such baskets became a specialized art in the 1800s. (The table on which it sits is hidden in shadow.) Travelers of the 1800s seldom traveled without umbrellas, since most climates have intermittent rain, and travel meant being much outdoors in the weather. From the 1840s to 60s, dots (called “spots” in Britain) were very fashionable, as on this umbrella.",

The hair sample has been carefully woven as if it were fabric. It is brunette hair, laboriously and lovingly done by a man's true love for him to carry with him. Attached to the frame around the photo is the pin for the back of the broach. A small ring attached to the top back of the frame allows this broach to be hung on a chain around the neck. In the image, a woman wears a day cap with large ruffled sides and a huge bow of the same fabric spreading over her dark bodice.",

It would be no longer than a modern American woman’s size 5 shoes, and as narrow as a child’s toddler size, though the upper shoe would expand to slightly wider when worn. Small feet were considered a sign of gentility. Thus, fashion illustrations show both men’s and women’s feet as no longer than their hands, and barely half as wide.",

Margaret was born seven years before her Irish father, young Tipton Smith Neel, died in Kansas. But her educated, reddish-haired mother became a member of the Church of Jesus Christ LDS, and, as a widow, took her little family to Utah, where she raised them by her sewing skills and growing their own food.",

Pantalets show beneath the younger girl’s dress, with white stockings and ankle laced shoes. The older girl's beads are likely of coral, much desired in the 1800s. Though the oldest is probably only 10, her ears are pierced for earrings-- perhaps when a female relative died and the earrings were gifted to the girl. Her hair seems to be long, probably smoothed back into a braid. The smaller girl sits in her high chair with straight, shoulder-length hair. Short sleeves indicate summer dresses.",

A original, long-time leader in the Church of Jesus Christ LDS Relief Society in Salt Lake City, Mary Isabella set in motion the Retrenchment Society which banished excess expenditures on fancy clothing. She promoted broad education of the highest order for women. She also contributed greatly to systematically promote the acquisition of materials to build the Salt Lake Temple, helping import materials that could not be obtained in the west. Though she is young here, the Hornes were eventually the parents of 15 children, including three sets of twins. Mary traveled in company with priesthood leaders to far settlements that needed direction and encouragement for their families in the sparsely-settled west.",

Note that the shoulder seam wraps over the shoulder and onto the back, which was common in all dresses of the mid-1800s. This was to give the shoulder silhouette a smooth line. Dress bodices in the mid-1800s were always lined in white muslin to give them strength for wearing, as well as seams wide enough to enable altering to accommodate dress sizes.",

Her sleeves are elbow length with two ruffles at the hem. A lace collar is at her neck over a thin leather necklace that locked with a key she gave to her husband, her own symbol of being bound to him in voluntary servitude. Her skirt is gathered beneath a gathered apron. A small, ruffled cap is fastened to the back of her hair. Hannah was tall and strong enough to lift her and carry her husband in her arms. Rejecting the doll-like helplessness of Victorian wives, she insisted on remaining a paid servant with her own money and maiden name, working hard and long, but retaining her own kind of independence. Quite literate, she kept diaries of all her doings, which are kept at Trinity College, Cambridge. Unkind books have been written from some diary extracts.",

    "description": "Perhaps the lowest class of working women are these “tip girls” who worked unloading refuse from rail cars after they came out of the mine and the useful coal was removed. The girls would stack the unwanted trash and dross from the cars onto the “tip” of the mountain of waste, building it ever higher. They wore whatever patched dresses they had with high necks and long sleeves to keep some dirt from their bodies. Note the scarves that cover their hair, necks, and upper shoulders. Also, note that they have pretty hats on top of the scarves to remind themselves and others they are still women with a sense of beauty remaining. Their skirts are cut short to enable them to bend, stretch and move about on the heap of waste. Below their skirts are boots to steady their ankles and prevent the dross from cutting their legs and feet. They had no time for self-improvement, and no more chance than the men to escape the filth and danger of the coal mine. One did what one had to buy food, sleep out of the rain, and survive.",

Intelligently, she has a specially carved yoke that fits her shoulders and back well, and distributes the weight of the milk cans. In her hands, she holds the leather straps that support the thick wire handles of the cans. To soften the load, she wears a plaid wool shawl across her shoulders beneath the yoke. Her sleeves are long and loose. A clean, white apron gives confidence to the buyers that the milk is fresh and clean. Her skirts clear the floor by a few inches to make walking easier and safer. You can bet money she isn’t constrained by a corset. These women were ubiquitous along the streets of any Victorian town or city. They had ladles and smaller cans to measure out the amount of milk bought at each house, store, or customer.",

She is too old to carry big cans on a yoke, although that may be a yoke hanging on the fence behind her. Likely, her dairy farmer husband or son has delivered her here for the day and will pick her up later. She wears a plaid, hooded capelet over head and shoulders, with a day cap ruffle around her cheerful face. Her warm sleeves are rolled up to facilitate measuring and pouring milk. She carries a measuring container in one hand, but we can tell the day is cold because she nestles one arm under her capelet when it is not in use. Her apron is white, and her skirt is several inches shorter than fashion decrees above her laced boots. Bending, measuring, and pouring does not allow for the floor-length or trailing skirts of the 1870s wealthy",

The girl on the left wears a hat, but appears to have a container fastened in back to hold her bait. Each woman wears two shirts on top of each other to keep their upper bodies warm in cold morning hours or inclement weather. As the day heats, they may shed the outer shirt. They try to keep their skirts out of the water, if possible. So skirt fronts are gathered, tucked between their legs, and fastened up to their back waistlines, leaving something that looks much like knickers. Below that they wear stockings and snug shoes to protect their legs and feet among the jagged rocks.",

Openings are now always center front with hidden buttons. (Zippers were not used until 1920-30, but mostly during and after World War II.) The difference between middle and upperclass clothing was a matter of excellence in fabric and expert tailoring. Hats were still a bit tall, as with the bowler on left, middle-high in the center, and regular top-hat on right. The top-hat of this decade does not flare out toward the top. Facial hair was now popular in several styles, shown below in men’s hair and beard styles",

In Meissen, Germany, Karl turned from his father's job as a fine china painter. Instead, he attended the Budig Institute in Dresden and married the daughter of the Director, Anna Mieth. After accidentally reading anti-Mormon literature, he met the Church of Jesus Christ LDS missionaries, and he and his wife were rapidly converted. In Utah, Maeser was sent by Brigham Young to found an Academy in Provo, Utah. He served hundreds, then thousands of students in many fields of study. His pay was infrequent and often only in vegetables and grains from the poor student families. Though poor himself, Karl served with excellent teaching. Brigham Young University is now a great and respected institution world-wide.",

Think of the movie villain tying the maiden to a railroad track – he’s always twirling his mustache ends to make them stand up or curl, as many of the men in the chart here have done. Enormous, full beards were also worn, sometimes falling to mid-chest, and spraying out in all directions (seen below). Another popular style for westerners was to have a beard only under the chin, as in the bottom row, far right. We also see here that ties had generally become more narrow than in previous decades. The triangular-style knot was coming into vogue, later called the “Windsor.” Note that many collars have been pressed to have their points flare away from the neck.",

His hair is short and neat, and his beard and longer mustache are welltrimmed. Born in Missouri in 1838 to parents Alvin and Mary Judd Winegar, John lived in the Utah South Bountiful Ward for 11 years as a farmer, raised stock, and served long in Church positions and Priesthood. With his cousin, William, he often hunted wild ducks, which clustered along the Jordan River in early mornings. Both men were the crack shots of the Valley. Their scores of ducks were quickly sold 6 days a week at five p.m.in Salt Lake City at the permanent open market. Numerous ducks benefitted his family and relatives with fresh meat.",

    "description": "Osmond Broad Shaw of Staffordshire, England, is probably in his 70s here. He wears the full beard and mustache more typical of older men. Men wore their hair short, but not every man in 1870 wore full beards, and younger men who did so usually trimmed them shorter than this example. (Osmond is shown in the 1840s with his wife Eliza, young and handsome!) In his youth, Shaw was a man of excellent English education in history, languages, and chemical science, taught and encouraged by his renowned schoolmaster father, Simeon Shaw. Unknown to each other, Osmond and his fiancée, Eliza, had separately and secretly joined the persecuted Church of Jesus Christ LDS in the late 1840s. A week before their marriage they had to admit to each other their hidden but staunch beliefs, no matter what the cost. Their confessions caused a dramatic burst of happiness for both! Laboring to be able to leave for America, both of them worked tirelessly to pay off debts and afford travel. Young, educated Osmond put on his old clothing 6 days a week and labored at the lowest working man's level packing in huge containers of straw the beautiful Spode and Wedgewood china wares for out-shipping. Eliza, an exquisite needle-woman, labored making stays (2-piece corsets,) for her demanding customers long hours each day. Upon their journey, they lost two babies to cholera in infested St. Louis, Missouri. Osmond and Eliza barely survived, but eventually made it to Salt Lake City. Finally, living happily amid the western Latter-Day Saints, and blessed with more children, Eliza's and Osmond's skills continued in sewing, fine carpentry, and in producing the first poured window glass in Salt Lake City. Carma owns samples of it.",

His white beard and mustache are well shaped by a fine barber, but he shows no sideburns. His nicely tailored clothing has the smaller collar, buttoned high, often seen in the 1870s. His black silk tie has a modern triangular knot with the collar folded over it. Born of an affluent family with the advantages of an excellent education for mind and talents, Serge descended from a line of high nobility in Switzerland. Encountering Church of Jesus Christ LDS missionaries in 1852, while still young, he firmly accepted their message. A spiritual man brought up in Pietistic traditions, he was the only one of his immediate family who was baptized into the Church. Courageously, Serge traveled alone to America. In later years, after much and varied service in missionary work, Ballif became President of the Swiss-German Mission. His large number of highly talented descendants range across the USA and beyond in modern times.",

He gave such long and rousing sermons in very hot St. George, Utah, he would perspire in streams down his forehead. His audiences enjoyed his unabashed humor with much laughter when he became overheated – he would lift off his wig, mop his forehead, then plop it back on his head. In most pictures of this decade, Smith wears a short, under-chin beard of gray or white. Such beards were quite common on men, not on the chin at all, but further back toward the neck. Native Americans were fascinated with Smith, who could remove false teeth, spectacles, a wig, a cane, and even a wooden leg. They called him, in their native language, “Man-who-comes-apart.” George A. lived a life jam-packed with service to the Church and his large family. He died rather early in 1875 at the age of 58.",

There is, perhaps, a narrower under-sleeve. Her skirt is drawn back and tucked up in the back showing huge, elegant folds. A satin ribbon with a back-bow surrounds her waist. Since we cannot see the lower skirt, we may assume that the overskirt has a wide trim in the colors of the ruched trim above. She is certainly wearing a corset and a cage crinoline beneath the skirt. (Can you imagine the effort to get into such a costume three times a day?) The woman’s pretty hat has a small brim with folded material above it, a narrow, pointed crown with an indented center, and a cluster of feathers on the side. It is coquettishly tipped down over her forehead. Such hats were attached with long hatpins catching the hairdo beneath. The large braid surrounding her back hair structure is most likely a hairpiece. The little girl’s dress and hair could have come from almost any era, even today’s fancy-dress. The low neckline is framed by a lightweight, multi-folded swath of fabric wrapped around to emphasize her lovely bare shoulders – a much-desired feature of most children’s clothing. The skirt is of two gathered flounces that fall to above her knees, and look like embroidered voile or eyelet edging. Her blond hair is in side ponytails with bangs.",

A very deep, soft v in the decolletage is mirrored by the soft V at the bottom of the bodice. Black lace finishes the sleeves, with blue lace at the hem of the teal overskirt. The colors together give a beautiful peacock impression An additional overskirt of deep blue and teal is in the back with many gathers, layers, and “pick-ups” in the two colors. (A pick-up is a technique of taking a lower point of the outer skirt, and lifting it up and under, where it is attached to the lining, thus making a graceful pouf in the outer skirt)",

A black bow is at the neck, and black buttons are on the front. Sleeves are slim with a dark mock-cuff and a white frill at the wrist. Her rough-looking boots indicate a working-level family. Note the hats. Both women have little hats perched on top of upswept hairstyles that are combed back on the sides. The woman on right has a short cotton jacket with a lace ascot at her neck and a ruffle at the jacket bottom. Loose sleeves have buttoned cuffs at the wrists. Her overskirt has a hem-edging of a print band with a ruffle beneath. Her underskirt has a similar print band with a longer ruffle beneath.",

The woman sitting has a dark jacket with a light bib-effect, perhaps of lace. The jacket buttons down the front, and has comfortably slim sleeves that widen slightly below the elbow. Her overskirt shows a 3-inch fringe-trim at the bottom, while her underskirt has an 8-inch border of apparently pleated fabric. She wears curled bangs with longer back hair tied low. The darker band around her neckline may be part of the jacket showing above the bib. A gold watch on a chain hangs from her neck to her bustline. Both she and her mother wear bold rings on their hands. The standing woman has a medium-colored linen or cotton jacket with a row of ball-buttons down the front to a very slight center point. Her sleeves are slim from shoulder to wrist. There is interesting lace or embroidered décor of white with black edging at the neck of the jacket, and a thin, white neckline frill. Her slightly flared overskirt is the same color and fabric as her jacket, but her underskirt is much darker and much more flared. She wears square-toed shoes. This is a posed, studio portrait, combined with the jewelry they wear, shows a fairly good income for this family.",

    "description": "A great fashion change came in the late 1870s. The figure was a corseted hourglass, but dresses were more slender than since the 1830s. Petticoats or underskirts with flounces often flared out below the knee. Having many layers and ruffles was admired. Underskirts were of contrasting fabrics. For formal occasions, there might be trains, but housewives and working women had little use for those. Most women wore white at throat and wrists. Hats continued in variety from feminine bowlers (center) to flaring coronas, and flat-brimmed headgear (right), to the excessively decorated outbursts of ruffles, lace, and feathers worn by the wealthy.",

Among the leisure class, trains were fashionable, despite their sweeping up street soil to pull into the house. The dress on left has an interesting train. A wide trim on her shoulders makes a V to the waist, then flares out again, not into a V, but into a loop through which a train passes. Anchored at the waistline, the train falls through the loop in wide folds to trail a couple of feet behind the dress. Below the gray train is a fuschia under-train of sharp pleats that trails another 8 inches. Sleeves are slim to the elbow but flare out to the wrists. A bonnet of white feathers and gathered lace has a rim and crown of fuscia. The dress sides gather up in back to join the loop. Matching trim and heavy fringe edge the gray hem. The jacket and skirt on right are medium-purple with darker purple trim on hems and wrists. Large, dark, front bows march from neck to ankle. The overskirt gathers into a sloping bustle in back, with folds of train in shades of dark purple. The under-skirt hem is bordered with a light-purple fabric in many pleats gathered by rosettes. A white frill is at neck and sleeve ends. Her bonnet is an circle of lavendar pleats surrounding an explosion of vari-colored feathers. Both ensembles are elaborate works of art that almost hide the women inside.",

Fashionable women in Salt Lake pushed back somewhat against his advice.) Along with tight corsets, a slight bustle on the sides and more in back emphasized the hourglass figure. Hats were narrow but made tall with piles of netting, ruffles, bows and flowers. Hairstyles featured mounds of curls upward and long ringlets trailing down the back, all much ornamented with lace and ribbons.",

A woman might even wear her hair down, as bathing in a fancy hairdo might cause catastrophe to elaborate hairstyles. Note that the teen girl here has a little hat with a silk or thin rubber snood to keep her long hair from getting tangled in the sea or lake. When she was not actually in the water, a bathing robe covered her costume from neck to feet and even had a hood to hide wet hair. The woman in the robe is not planning to get wet above her shoulders. (Nobody was swimming the Channel in these ensembles.)",

(Few women dared to do many things Mattie dared to do independently.) Her great difference is not the front or sides, which were similar to more elaborate 1870s styles, but that she had no long, hanging braids or ringlets in the back. She did, however, mound her curls on top. She was lucky to have naturally curly hair which quickly combed into this attractive style. She wears a fetching collar of sheer ruffles around her neck on a dress with interesting sections of smocking in the yoke. By this time, shoulder seams were cut at the shoulders, rather than dropped. Mattie was a Welsh-born immigrant, a trained physician, a Utah Women's Rights Advocate, and, in Utah, the first female legislator in the U.S. On November 3, 1896, Dr. Cannon became the first female State Senator elected in the United States, defeating her own husband, Angus M. Cannon, on the ballot. She used her powers to promote the Utah Board of Health and educate widely about cleanliness and other improvements.",

Here she has a pretty frill around her neck in a dark wool dress highlighted by white cording on the edges of the collar and other places on the dress. She was known as “one of the beauties of Salt Lake City.” Rosa married a professional hunter. Known as a crack shot, William Winegar won shelves full of silver trophies. When their six children were fairly young, William died suddenly of heart failure. Rosa had to enlarge her life-long skill as a speedy seamstress on her treadle machine to support her children and herself. She always made her own patterns and was a beautiful designer and hand- finisher. She also made male clothing for her husband, son, and baby grandson. \"Grama Rosa’s\" big round sewing basket was brought to Provo after her death, where her granddaughter Carma, age 7, learned to sew with it from that day on.",

The point of greatest interest was in long back hair. As seen here, the back hair could be braided in various designs, woven, curled in ringlets, or hanging in simple waves. Bows, combs, and often flowers were attached to build height with ornamentation. Such styles welcomed hairpieces for length, style, or simply more altitude on top. Online searches for hairstyles of the 1870s often have illustrations or videos showing how to achieve such styles. The web page for this particular image is given under “source” below. Of course, the average woman of small means or busy lifestyle on a farm or with children would not wear such elaborate styles. Still, she might try for this general idea, with smooth fullness in front, sides gathered to the back, and either wrapped in a twist or bun to keep hair out of the way or to let it fall in whatever back waves or braids she could quickly manage.",

You will have noticed the changing fashions in faces illustrated at various times. In the 1800s, the ideal woman had drooping eyelids and tiny pursed lips, even though no living woman ever had such a mouth.

Dress – the crowning glory of fashion with long sleeves and high neck for the day, and shorter sleeves and low-cut neckline for the evening.

In addition, this one-piece suit had a closed crotch, but an opening in the back for toilet functions. An expandable, ruched gusset over the breasts would adjust to a woman’s bust size. It was hailed as sensible by many women but did not sell well due to poor construction. More successful (and prettier) was a pattern to make such a suit at home, developed by Annie Jenness Miller, a well-known author, and lecturer. During the 20th century, when clothing became less restrictive, the one-piece suit was abandoned by women in favor of 2-piece underwear, but had already become adapted to and adopted by men as the wellknown, traditional, drop-butt union suit.",

    "description": "This was another example of women striving for more comfortable, sensible clothing. The battle to wear any kind of trousers had ended in arrests and cries of disaster when “bloomers” were first seen. But society was less liable to revolt against clothing that was unseen. (Though one wonders how a wrist-length, ankle-length flannel could be bearable in “Spring and Summer.” Thus, one-piece underwear was part of the revolution to also eliminate trailing skirts that swept dirt into the home. During the 20th century, when clothing became less restrictive, the union suit was abandoned by women for two-piece underwear, but this had already become adapted to and adopted by men as the well-known, traditional, drop-butt union suit worn beneath their outerwear by men from bankers to farmers.",

    "description": "The style a woman wore depended on the time of the decade. The Left corset was higher cut over the rear end, allowing for a crinoline or bustle to protrude out from the waistline in a pronounced derrière, as in earlier styles of 1870 on pp. 32-35 above. Right corset clung lower over the hips, allowing for an elliptical crinoline, or one of the trailing underskirts shown for the later 1870s on pp. 45-48 above. Both styles emphasized a woman’s rear-end, but with either a higher & exaggerated out-thrust or a lower, more subdued emphasis. Note that both corsets supported the bust line, rising no higher than the breast center, allowing a gown’s neckline to plunge deeply indeed, usually emphasizing a woman’s cleavage. With a cleavage emphasis, a high chemise like the one on right would need to be cut very much lower.",

The upper hoops would fold up behind the small of the back of the sitting woman, and the lower hoops would collapse behind her knees. A half-bustle or strapped-on pillow would allow the same range of motion. In later years, smaller, shaped pillows might be made to follow the reduced and sloping fashion at the back of a dress.",

For evening, a train might extend even further behind. Note- there are no hoops over the lap so a woman might sit or bend without the front flipping up. She wore a petticoat over the hoops to allow the skirt to lie smoothly and without ridges. In cold weather, she might wear a number of petticoats beneath the crinoline to keep warm. In hot weather, the absence of under-petticoats would allow for some air circulation. (One remembers in the original film, The King and I, when the hooped Siamese women were startled by British bearded men, they lifted their hoops and fled, Revealing All. They hadn’t had time to sew underwear.)",

Such a corset might be preferred for women who had to do some work, and thus be able to bend at the waist, such as housewives and mothers, and women in service jobs that required bending, but still needed to show fashion sense – dressmakers and hat makers, for example. The personal dressers of high-fashioned, wealthy women were expected to show the fashion sense of their mistresses, but needed flexibility to dress the mistress, put on her shoes and stockings, and style her hair.",

An open dress hem was easiest to pull up to change diapers. From there, the furbelows on the gown were up to the parents’ purse and sense of prestige. For poor parents, a flour sack could be made into a basic gown. For the wealthy, any amount of ruffles, tucks, yokes, lace, and ribbons were fastened in beautiful arrangements on a very long gown. This gown has a little lace-covered yoke with a sheer lace ruffle at the neck and bottom of the yoke. The hem is embroidered with scallops, below several rows of tucking. Many antique Christening gowns had skirts more than a yard long and were made of the finest silk or cotton voile, embroidered and lavishly decorated.",

Most children and adults who worked in cloth mills developed lung diseases because of the poor ventilation and ever-present lint in the air. The mistreatment of women and children in the mills is the great shame of the industrial revolution and greedy leaders/owners. Child Labor laws were not enforced in the US until 1938. Before that time, children were used in all kinds of labor.",

    "description": "Children of wealth dress much like their parents. The girls have skirts with poofed derrières, either with bustles, or petticoats with stiff ruffles to mimic bustles. Even the little toddler has a backside overskirt that stands out. The two older girls have overskirts and underskirts, all edged with trim and/or embroidery, and many black buttons on the gray dress. The toddler has a striking edging of black on yellow. White frills at sleeve ends and necks are de rigueur for girls, as are high-fashion white stockings above various styles of shoes. Hair is center-parted, sides combed back, and long hair behind, like their mothers. The boys wear round-collared white shirts with colored bow ties, vests, and shorter coats. But while the older boy wears knickers and red stockings with his double-breasted coat, the younger boy has a light-brown kilt above knickers and a single-button coat with wide cuffs. His stockings are white and his boots are brown.",

Particularly popular were these high-waisted styles that mimicked Regency dress. Later, the book Little Lord Fauntleroy, by Francis Hodgson Burnette, caused another hot trend in boys’ clothes of dark velvet suits with abundant lace at collars and cuffs. Mothers adored them. Boys barely suffered them.",

A belt on the bias has a huge bow in the back and mirrors the two rows of bias trim on the underskirt. The ruffle edging the overskirt is also cut on the bias. Black trim edges the yoke and sleeves. The underskirt bias bands, as well as the bottom hem, all feature black trim. A very narrow edge of lace surrounds the almost-square neckline. This dress would be as pretty and acceptable for best dress on a young girl of today as it was 150 years ago.",

Guns were used on predators attacking cattle or cowboys, or in Butch’s case, robbing trains and banks. Chaps, still used, are individual leather leg coverings over trousers that protect from daily hazards in working with cattle, horses, and other livestock. They guard riders' legs against scraping on brush, injury from cactus thorns, sagebrush, mesquite, and other prickly vegetation. They leave the seat and front open for riding and toilet functions.",

Coats could have hidden or patch pockets, with or without flaps. All men wore vests buttoned high. These three have stand-up shirt collars with a visible tie surrounding the neck. Trousers were straight-legged, and fell almost to the floor in back, but were cut higher in front to the top of the arch. Two men wear low-crowned bowler hats, while the center man is dressed formally in a thigh-length black coat and a top hat. The shoes appear to be two-toned leather with a dark piece up the center front, perhaps an early form of Oxford shoe. They all have elevated heels. The wealthy had excellent and expensive tailors and chose very fine woolens and linens. The Middle-class adopted the same styles, but with less expensive fabrics and tailoring. The poor bought from second-hand shops and carts but tried for fashion as possible.",

The vest is collarless and cut with a slight inverted V below the bottom button.

A white, starched shirt shows only in a stand-up collar with forward-folded collar points, and below the coat sleeves in the precise half-inch of white that must show. A dark, polka-dot tie or ascot is at his throat, tucked into the vest neck. His trousers have a narrow stripe in the wool, which is distorted at the bend of his knee. His face is clean-shaven, and his hair is combed straight back.",

The rules were still changing almost yearly, resulting in vast differences in player performance. The two leagues participated in a World's Series starting in 1884, with the NL winning all but one. THE UNIFORM – Casey wears a regular short-sleeved shirt over a one-sleeved long undershirt. The missing sleeve leaves his pitching arm unrestricted to throw. The shirtfront is buttoned to the neck with a pocket on his left. Below a dark belt in team colors, is a pair of knickers. Black knee socks are above flexible leather shoes. The leather ball of his days is not like modern baseballs and was often made by the pitcher himself. Casey’s cap is form-fitting in the colors of his team, but with a small brim. (If you haven’t read the poem since 6th grade, the “Mighty Casey” arrogantly lets 2 strikes go by with haughty sneers. But then he misses the third and loses the game. A treatise on hubris.)",

Almost all men had mustaches, and many had beards as well. A table of hairstyles and facial hair is below. His well-pressed coat buttons high, with a small coat collar, edged in a narrow, glossy trim. The white mandarin collar is tied around with a narrow ascot that flares wide beneath a single, simple knot. A fancy tie-pin holds the ascot in place. The vest beneath is not seen enough for description, except that it is about as high-buttoned as his coat. Earp’s greatest fame came from his gunfight at the OK corral, made into a popular movie a century later.",

Her jacket is of dark fabric down to the hips, with an attached, wide swath of velvet gathered around and up to her right side. A bustle of velvet loops falls behind her skirt. The sleeve cuffs are of the same velvet. A wide bow and fall of Venician lace is tied around her neck. A narrow collar of the jacket is barely seen above it, with a tiny white ruff above that. Her skirt is alternating rows of loose, wide ruching, and four tight bands of ruching.

His coat collar is of medium depth, as is his six-button vest collar. As frequent, his coat opening has glossy trim or top-stitching all the way around. His sleeves and trousers are comfortably roomy. His stiff collar and shirt-front are well starched, with shirt-points pressed out from a wide neck opening. A bow-tie of medium color and width is around the collar. His very short hair is combed straight back. A full handlebar mustache follows the fashion. His shoes are new and well-cared-for. The wife has a tight-fitting, jacket-like bodice, with a split pannier overskirt attached to a deep, V-front hip seam. A quilted trim connects the bodice and overskirt around her hips. Fifteen tiny metal buttons close the front, topped by a small round collar and a narrow, horizontal broach. The collar appears trimmed like the hipline band. Above the collar is the requisite white ruff against her throat, typical of any and every day-dress, easy to detach and wash. White scalloped cuffs end her ¾ length sleeves. The skirt is moderately gathered, with a ten inch flounce on the bottom. The flounce has a gathered ruffle at its top. There is the hint of a bustle-fall behind the skirt. Her hair is in tight curls or waves over her forehead on each side of a middle part. A large, soft bow on top is her hair ornament.",

    "description": "Although there were bustles in the mid-1870s, evolving fashion decreased the bustle size, and slid major fullness down behind the knees with an added train for fashion occasions. (Working women and the less-wealthy could not afford the cost or inconvenience of trains. Feminists decried trains as a spreader of dirt and disease.) But in the mid-1880s, bustles came back and grew from modest and hip-high to large and just below the waistline. As the decade marched on, those high bustles became more and more voluminous. At the same time, corsets extended down onto the hips for the dropped- waist and included a long front busk (stiff bone or metal insertion) that actually forced a woman to bend her body into a breasts-forward-bottom-protruding S shape. If she didn’t obey the busk, it might pierce her low-stomach clothing and even her skin. (Were fashion designers sadists, or did they care more for the money earned from changing the fashions more than the comfort of women?) There was even sold a cage of flat metal strips that prevented splitting corset bones from piercing the skin. But by 1889 into the 1890s, the fashion changed again. Now waists were even smaller, bustlines were lower, and the enormous bustle was gone. Padded petticoats, however, filled out the hips to emphasize the tiny waistline.",

    "description": "Before the mid-1880s ballooned out in bustles, the early 1880s gloried in a slim silhouette from neck to hem – except for formal occasions that demanded a train. All examples here have a corseted waistline and a fuller bust and hipline to emphasize it. The skirt was very slim with fullness behind the knees provided by shaped petticoats. Slim skirts were called by some “hobble skirts,” which necessitated small steps beneath its restrictive hemline. Much prestige was earned by the wealthy in expanding on decorations of great intricacy in folds, fabric swoops and tie-ups, lace, fringes, ruffles, and bows all over the ensemble. All bodices have a white frill at the neckline which can be removed for laundering, even the pink low-cut evening dress. A little child is lost amidst the colorful frou-frou. Hair was piled on top with ornaments or tall-perched bonnets, equally embellished with feathers, flowers, etc.",

The sleeves are gathered at the shoulder to pouf up, although the rest of the sleeve is snug down to a turned-up velvet cuff with a double fall of lace beneath. The bottom center of the jacket is an inverted V held in place by boning inside the jacket. Her body is held in form by a hip-length, boned corset. A pleated overskirt with a hem cording is swagged and tied up at her right hip with a multi-looped bow and trailing ribbons. The bustle is modest for this date, and covered with long loops of fabric that match the overskirt. Her underskirt shows three flounces of a contrasting fabric with a scalloped band of lace and embroidery at the bottom of each flounce. A small white frill finishes the hem, and likely matches the neck and wrist frills. Her hair is piled high on the crown with curled bangs and long ringlets trailing down in back. When she goes out to visit, she will wear a bonnet. If it is cold, she may wear a thigh-length coat with a flared back to allow for her bustle. She will wear kid gloves and carry a muff.",

The evening gown, left, has four layers of flounce below the overskirt, each trimmed with silk flowers and leaves, borders of wide lace, ribbons, and ruched satin extensions. Four layers of deep pink, looped, 9-inch ribbon lie atop the bustle. The two center dresses highlight striking contrasts in color: light lilac satin with deep purple velvet borders, and light chartreuse pleats and swag with black velvet insertions. The right dress has swags of checked purple fabric separated by tightly-pressed trims of grape pleating and ruching. Details emphasize more, more, more! The neckline and sleeve-cuff treatments are elaborate.",

The closure is hidden by another leather strap. Cuffs and stand-up collar. may be of suede. The jacket back is cut extremely full to extend over the large bustle. The skirt is pleated, and falls to the knee, beneath which one has leather boots, and the other has knee-high corduroy spats. One wears a typical but feminized bowler hat, and the other has a flat-topped, feminized bowler. Both hats would need to be well anchored with several long hat pins not to fly off during the hunt.",

    "description": "It seems a truism that the larger the skirt, the smaller the hat. Bustles and fullness made 1880 skirts voluminous. Thus, hats are fairly small and close to the head. That would reverse in the 1890s. Here we have women with curled bangs wearing an assortment of much decorated, but fairly close-fitting bonnets. They are made of shaped felt, woven straw, and free-form fabric, probably over buckram hat forms beneath. Bonnets and hats were a very important accessory, as a woman would not be seen out-of-door without a bonnet, except sometimes in her own yard or garden. Thus, procuring a few hats that would match outdoor dresses was essential. Lace and feathers abound, as do tie-on ribbons of satin and lace. Bonnet at center bottom seems to have a bird on top with a head-frill and long pink tail-feathers trailing behind. The poor also knew the century’s requirement for head-coverings and might add a feather or worn silk flower to spruce up an old hat for all purposes.",

Later, in the 1890s, the hipline became lower and rounded, and the back of the corset extended only a little farther than the hips did. There were even corsets to fit plumper ladies who might endure 28-inch cinching (center right), rather than the desired 16-18 inch waist for young ladies (bottom row). Corsets laced up in the back so a woman could adjust a new bustle to her desired waistline, with assistance. Once adjusted, the corset hooked up the front so a woman could put it on herself. One primary purpose of the corset was to support the breasts. Modern bras were not invented until 1914. None of the bustles or corsets felt comfortable. They were unhealthy for internal organs, and required shallow breathing. But that was the price of “beauty” for the age.",

They ended inches above the skirt hem on the chance that the skirt might flip up. What is horrifying to modern women is the fact that drawers had no crotch covering. The crotch seam was open from fore to aft so that ladies could use both hands to hold up all their undergirdings during toilet functions, and merely had to squat over a pot of some kind. Besides, the corset held the top of pantalets solid against the waist and hips so there was no chance of pulling drawers down for toilet functions. This was one reason maidens were always accompanied by an older woman when men were around.",

    "description": "Before the sewing machine, fabrics were cut to size, then hand-sewn with needle and thread using 1/16 inch stitches. Even one skirt-length seam could take an hour to sew properly, and might later need to be unpicked (another half hour or more) to re-sew the seam looser or tighter to fit the body (a third hour). Women were judged by how tiny and straight they could make their stitches. Dressmaker assistants to reputable dress designers often had to work in dim back-rooms or by candle-light. Once sewing machines were available, the same seam could be finished more perfectly and sturdily in minutes. Clothing patterns became available for home use, allowing many women to become quite capable of sewing clothes for their own families. Other women became proficient enough to start their own home dressmaker’s business in recreating fashions from fashion plates and photographs of the “latest thing.” This mother with a small daughter (and a parrot and cat) rejoices in her own pretty 1885 dress of tiny waist and swathed hips over a bustle. As hinted by the presence of the girl, she can also make clothing for her daughter. This machine was a treadle model, that had no need of an outside power source. A convenient machine table has drawers for accessories, thread, buttons and other sewing tools.",

    "description": "Before the electric iron, heavy cast iron frames held hot charcoal, with a lid closed over them. In 1882, the first electric iron was patented but depended on both the electrification of the room where it was used (only in big cities) and the ability of the person to judge the temperature of the iron so as not to burn the fabric. (An electric iron with an adjustable thermostat was not invented until 1935.) But ironing did have to be done, especially on cotton and linen clothing, that wrinkled dreadfully after washing. Cool irons were necessary for silks, voiles, and fragile fabrics. So some professionals and tailors might have an “iron-heating ► stove” on which many irons could be continually heating. The stove was kept filled with coal or wood via the drawer you see below, right. Wood or leather handles were changeable from iron to iron as needed. Folks without electricity bought a few, solid, cast irons and heated them on the kitchen stove, alternating irons as they cooled off.",

    "description": "At top, a dress and coat show front and back views. The coat stands open with curly lamb’s-wool bands at opening, hem, pocket flaps, and around the collar. Beneath is a dress with horizontal bands of tightly ruched fabric and bottom pleating. The dress has short, petaled sleeves, a double-breasted opening, a horizontal drape below the hipline, and a gathered underskirt. A neckline inset is of lace or embroidered cotton, and has a fabric rosette at one neckline corner. In the back, the drape gathers into a knot with two hanging ends. A narrow, white ruffle is below the hem. In the family scene, Mother is tying on her little girl’s bonnet. The child is dressed like an adult with a tight coat, low pleated skirt, and heeled ankle boots. Older girl has a snug dress from lace collar to thighs. Slim sleeves have lace cuffs. A diagonal opening fastens with frogs. Below her hips are 3 bands of striped satin and lace, with a gathered, hem flounce. Ankle boots have heels. Middle girl has a jacket with insets of velvet with satin binding. A wide beaded belt swaths her hips. Her velvet skirt has vertical pintucks on the side and ruffled dark lace at the hem. She wears heeled ankle boots. Mom wears a low-waist jacket with tails and looped fabric in back. Her overskirt swags up toward the rear and has long bottom fringe. An underskirt of many satin panels has décor at the hem. Jacket edgings and collar may be lace or curly lamb. A fluffy hat seems to be close loops of lace around a crown. High-heeled calf boots show no opening. Fashion for her family looks like Mom’s # 1 concern in life. (But this IS a fashion magazine.)",

    "description": "This 4 or 5-year old has a light-weight coat with wide bands of lace around the front opening, neck, and hem. The lower back of the coat has folds, pin-ups, and curving tucks of the coat fabric to make a very modest, rounded bustle over the top of diagonally pleated panels (seen in the back view). A colored ribbon is tucked into the bustle folds. Above the bustle are 8 vertical pin-tucks, clustered into a lower fastening. The coat cuffs are of fabric ruching with ruffles top and bottom, with a tiny lace ruffle below, just at the wrist. Such clever details make this coat enchanting. Her dress is made of horizontal bands of ruching, alternating wide and narrow across her bodice. The top of the bodice is smooth and possibly sheer, with a lace ruffle around her neck. That ruffle is bound to the bodice with cording. Below her hips are five solid ruffles in her skirt, ending at the same level as her coat hem. The lowest skirt segment is of tightly pressed pleats. Below white stockings, her buttoned ankle boots have a scalloped opening and top binding. The heels are only a half-inch high for a little girl.",

    "description": "The stand-out bustles give away the year, and skirt lengths tell the girls’ ages. Most bonnets are taller than the heads beneath. Jackets cover overskirts, with underskirts below. Ribbons and lace make up two outfits. Pleats and swags adorn the rest. Ankle boots with gaiters are on some feet below white or colored stockings. Only one girl dares step into the water. Two girls have fishnets, and one carries a toy boat, but only one seems desirous of entering the water. This may be a cold and windy shore to inspire such warm clothing.",

    "description": "These winter outfits push girls’ figures into an S-shape, with thrust-back hips. Though slender in youth, they wear corsets and bustles that emphasize such a shape. All bonnets are particularly tall and ornate. Girl far left wears an open blue jacket not intended to button over the ruffles on her bodice. With a stand-up collar and slim sleeves, it tops a saffron and black striped skirt, probably gathered. Stockings in black ankle boots warm her legs. Small girl in yellow has a jacket with swags on one side of the front and jacket hem, over a yellow gathered skirt. Purple bows, cuffs, stockings, and coat-yoke contrast. Her hat echoes the colors. Girl center-right has a gray velvet jacket with black spots and lace edging. A blue blouse with a high collar matches her stockings. Her pleated velvet skirt reflects the jacket, but has a wide panel of lace on the skirt front, and a bustle pouf behind. Girl in green has red bows on hat, shoulder and coat front. One lapel and her cuffs are of lamb’s wool, and the other side front has huge buttons or poofs. An overskirt panel has lambs-wool welts and her skirt has a high border. The woman’s coat or dress is lavender with two rows of front buttons and a long, fringed overskirt swagged back into her large bustle. The overskirt has a darker pattern of criss-cross woven into the fabric. She wears tan gloves below 3/4-length sleeves.",
