        "description": "Smocks were the most common working man's clothing of the 1700s & 1800s in both the old world and the new. This is a linen smock from America with smocking in front and a placket of four buttons. There is a little smocking at the collar line in center back. (It is not a \"round smock,\" which would have a placket on the back side as well, to allow wearing it reversed.) On the shoulders are double layers of linen that cover all raw edges, and are called the \"straps,\" for reinforcing the smock. Sometimes, a strongly made smock could be used for future generations. Nothing went to waste or was thrown away if there was still some use in it. American smock fronts have varied smocking designs, with only two inches of smocking on the cuff-lines of the sleeves. Note that the smocking does not go all the way around the cuffs, but is centered, and is there simply for beauty's sake. Other pleats in the sleeve fabric attach to the side of the cuff opening. Under the rectangular arm sections are the usual seveninch squares sewn into the sleeves and body as folded, triangular gussets. On the shoulders, the long “straps,” and the facings inside the smock, cover the raw seams of sleeve insertions and are pressed inward toward the neckline. This completely covers the raw edges of the sleeves and straps. All raw edges of the fabric are turned under with small, hand whip-stitching that is hardly seen on the outside of the smock, this adds strength to the garment. Such construction will survive generations of work and washing. At the bottom of the side seam (French-seamed) is a tiny gusset at the top of the side slit to prevent side-seam tearing. There is plenty of room within this smock for a farmer to comfortably lift hay, drive a team, etc. The smock could be any neutral color of linen or dyed to a dark navy blue or brown for little boys' smocks. In New England, Nova Scotia or Canada smocks could even be wool, subtly striped, and much longer. Wool would protect men better than linen from cold, rain, snow, and dirt.",

He also wears a broad-brimmed, low crowned hat and heavy leather work shoes.

        "description": "This man's calf-length smock hadbeen repaired, as we can see a carefully reinforced seam just left of bottom center. A tear had taken place from the front hem and upward about 15 inches. Perhaps that split in the fabric was there when the smock was first made, many years before, and had been sewn up to prevent fraying. Then the fabric could still be used as good linen to create a long-sleeved smock for a man. This design has only a square of smocking stitches in top front, no wider than the flat collar spreads. All stitching and openings are identical on front and back, making it a reversible \"Round Smock.\" The sleeves have the expected section of smocking near the narrow cuffs, but not all the way around the cuffs. It had lasted a long time by being used on both, reversible sides for many years, or more than one generation. The owner donated it to the historic village. It is definitely a New England type of smock and is badly tacked up for this display. The shoulder width would have dropped a little off the farmer's shoulders when worn.",

He also has a scarf tied under his collar. The trousers are the renowned, sailor bell-bottoms. If a sailor fell into the sea, he could lift a wet bell-bottom above the waves, trap air in the voluminous leg, and hold it tight at the bottom to provide a float. Wet fabric would hold the air in for a quite a while as he waited for help. Chances are good that many sailors on older ships wore not uniform sailor garb, but whatever they had in shirts or trousers. It probably depended on the strictness of the owner, and who was paying for his clothing.",

Note the other style, which was rather an enlarged cap to surround the piled-up hairdo, but with ruffled lace around the face and under the chin and back hair, with openings for the ears. It tied under the chin. One supposes that a woman wearing this style would also carry a parasol against the sun. It was a common undertaking for a woman to buy fal-lals to redecorate her bonnets for various seasons and occasions. The black bonnet with black ribbons, bottom right, was probably a mourning bonnet, which should be worn for 6 months to 2 years after the death of a loved one (depending on a woman’s closeness to the deceased. Widow = 2 years. Parent or child = 1 year. Other relatives, 6 months or so).",

        "description": "Women who could afford them also wore pantalets, leg coverings for each leg, attached to each other only at the waistline front and back, with buttons or ties. This left the crotch open for toilet functions. (They wore bands and folded cloths for menstruation.) The hem of the pantalet could be ruffled with lace and embroidery as at far left.",

        "description": "Over the chemise women wore a corset to hold up their breasts and narrow their waistlines. The model left holds her corset. In the early 1800s, corsets might only come down to the waist, and were barely cinched. Later in the century, small waistlines were prized, so corsets came down to the hips, and were tightly cinched-in at the waist.",
