Made of beige and white striped cotton/linen.  ,"This shirt is made mostly of plain rectangles cut to fit one half of the man's waistline measurement, or the full width of his shoulders plus 4 inches. Two large rectangles are the front or back, sewn together, or could be made from folding a long piece of fabric at shoulders. The shoulders have a horizontal slit for a neck opening, which is then cut slightly down in front in a shallow U to fit the forward thrust of the neck. This slit extends from the center point of the front and back out toward the top of the shoulder. The entire slit should be 4 inches larger than the size of the man's neck. This results in a larger neckline where the shirt is gathered in the center back, and on the fronts to each side of the placket opening. This allows for expansion of the chest. This slit (once gathered in) is covered on the inside with all seams tucked inside of a long, triangular gusset, called a ""strap."" Note that the back neckline is gathered only in a center spray, not all the way across the back, as so many supposedly 1800s shirts are incorrectly made today with a back yoke.  On the center front is an 8 inch long vertical slit opening of this pullover shirt. The slit is faced with a rectangle of fabric, making about 2 inches facing on each side and a bit more at the bottom of the slit. It is wise to sew this slit facing with a machine and with tiny-size stitches on the bottom 2 inches of the slit. After pressing, add judicious tiny stitching with finer thread, by hand, to secure the extremely small seam allowance on this bottom 2 inches. The entire shirt can look worn out and won't wash well if the center front facing gets torn or ragged.   On a work shirt of wool, which was often red, blue or possibly brown dull-striped fabric, an actual collar was only added at the neckline half the time. Usually, only a collar band was sewn on to secure the neck for a great many work shirts.  ",Striped shirt made for model Ron Reed with photo by Wayne Keyes

Such coats were rarely lined, but often had patch pockets for a handkerchief and odds and ends. Or it could have bound pockets secured with the same wool, as seen here. In center back at the hem was extra room afforded by a box pleat or a stitched pleat over a slit.

Yet there were in Salt Lake and its environs enough paying customers for all sorts of horoscopes. Job always claimed he was a Mormon, and his first wife, Hannah, left him when she could no longer live around his spiritual divinations, which she saw were very powerful in controlling other people. Thomas then married another sweet woman named Elizabeth and for many more years went on teaching difficult school subjects in private schools, with winter sessions, in Utah and Idaho.

Her habit is a long skirt and separate bodice with at least 45 tiny (probably silver) buttons sewn onto narrow tape decorations. She favors the military effect. Her jacket collar is turned up and lined with a Betsy Collar from an Empire-high blouse for riding. There are 1840-style epaulette sleeves over her long-narrow ones. The edges of the epaulettes even have buttons and tape on them. Her cuffs expose a white frill at the wrist. The left side of her skirt two feet longer at the hemline, which modestly shields her ankles while she is mounted side-saddle. She holds up some excess length, and we can glimpse only the front of her narrow, square-tipped shoe style. (It was considered a titillation of male desire if a man walked near an exposed, easily-touched ankle.) She wears white stockings and black leather slippers with some heel on them to secure the foot in a stirrup. She holds an ivory handled crop, one of two she owned (still in private collections). Her black silk bonnet was removed and placed on the table so the painter, could capture her profile. The bonnet has a fine, black, silk, lace veil to float behind her while she rides. The inside of the bonnet brim is a flattering shade of pale pink to reflect on her face. Her natural dark hair is pulled back in a high bob, with two sections of hair on the front sides are twisted into ringlets, bound together with small cords to hang in front of her ears with her bonnet on. When this painting is seen close up, as Carma has held it in her hands, it is possible to see sets of combs that keep Emma's hair smooth on each side of her head, each positioned forward at eyebrow height. When Emma appeared in her bonnet to pose for Sutcliffe Maudsley, one conjectures he complained he could not see her profile. His artistic strength was only to paint profile portraits, so he must have requested her to remove the bonnet. Also, the fictitious drape with gold fringe and cording at right is customarily added by the artist as ""the drape of honor"" in a portrait.",LDS Church Archives.

This excellent mannequin was made by LDS Displays long ago. Carma designed his clothing: the first representation, ever, of the Prophet Joseph Smith wearing LINEN, which was appropriate and much used in the hot, humid weather of the Midwest. He is seated at an Empire style table made at the time of his birth, 1806. His frock coat is of pumpkin-colored linen with a pleated opening in the center back skirt. A tiny white piping surrounds all edges of his coat but the hemline. Pocket flaps over his hips are sewn into the waistline seam and are also piped in white. Buttons in the front tabs are medium sized while those on the coat cuffs are small. Two buttons at the back waistline pleats are large. All made to look like correct white bone for that period. This design was made from a white linen frock coat which was an 1845 antique Carma bought in the Northeast USA (shown elsewhere). Smith's trousers are cotton/linen of narrow, equal stripes of beige and soft green. They have bottom straps, buttoned under the shoe sole, that hold trousers neatly down on the leg. A vest of mottled beige linen with a shawl collar covers his fine white linen shirt. Small black and gold designs grace the silky cravat which wraps around his standing collar to button in the back. His boots have proper square toes.  ","The LDS Historic Sites Exhibits made this accurate mannequin and originally put it in Joseph Smiths Vermont Birthplace Site. However, the clothing was totally incorrect. Later they enlarged the site and asked Carma to make new and better clothes. She dressed him entirely in linen for the hot sticky weather of the Midwest, seated at a Nauvoo table with assorted papers he owned and used. Never before had he been shown wearing proper linen for an Illinois summer. Years later, when this exhibit was exchanged for another, it was all transported to Salt Lake City and warehoused. In the 1980s, Carma desired some of the clothing for display, and the Church gave her the entire mannequin, plus the use of Church furniture. It was placed behind glass in the 2005 Joseph Smith 200th Birthday Exhibit in the Joseph Smith Building on BYU Campus. Carma made all this clothing and used her own 1840s books to display on the table. The exhibit extended to 6 months, allowing 33,000 people to view this scene of 11 dressed mannequins over a summer and into winter. It joined with displays showing men, women and child of Joseph's entire lifetime (1805-1844).  Clothing and hair designed by Carma, and clothing made by Carma.

We see a beautifully-shaped velvet guard over each arm-slit, with tiny blue velvet buttons added for decoration. The neckline is closed with two metal buttons and a chain between. It was made by Smith's favorite Nauvoo tailor, Colonel Bills of the Nauvoo Legion, who gave it to beloved Joseph as a gift.The lining of ""bear cloth"" is a 1inch thick shag of faded wool woven into a dense fur-like fabric, which would prove enormously warm. Carma handled the cloak and pulled open the yarns of the lining. There she found that it was not originally brown, but bright green in the early construction of the cloak.The cloak was handed back to the Bills family after Josephs death. They wore it for at least another generation during which the outside fabric was torn and heavily mended in different colors of thread.

They both wore light, strapped-under trousers with darker tail coats, and sleeve cuffs turned down formally. It is barely discernible that Hyrum is also wearing a light, if not white, vest, as is Joseph.

An old vest of the l830s is buttoned up very high, but shows the silk of his tie. His frock coat is completely skirted, and his shoulders are free of padding, making them narrow at the sleeve tops. Above a starched, turned-down collar and a bow tie, Smith still had considerable gray hair cut below his earlobes (portrait of face and hairstyle is elsewhere in this document). Even with the best of clothes in the mid-1800s, it was impossible to keep shined shoes because of muddy or dusty roads of hard beaten earth everywhere people could walk. This gentle man lived a very reverent and spiritual life to his death. Smith was tall and lanky all his life, which caused unusual difficulties for photographers. They always used photo stands to hold the necks of subjects steady for the full required time of exposing the image. But the man had to find enough books to stack behind John in order to get his stand high enough to grip the back of Johns neck. The stand is seen behind Johns calves, humorously resting on top of the stacked books. Still, the slight blur of his hands indicates a little movement. The necessity of remaining perfectly motionless for up to 90 seconds is why most old photos show unsmiling faces. After his brother, Joseph Smith Sr. died in Nauvoo, John became Patriarch to the entire Church. Later, in Salt Lake City, John was called by Brigham Young to be president of the first large Salt Lake Stake. A stake is a collection of 5 to 15 congregations, or wards.","Online picture from Covey-Richards Family History Website, The Dearies., http://www.thedearies.com/2012/04/john-smith.html."

At this date there was still fullness at the top of slightly dropped-shoulder sleeves. She was fastidious about her day caps, collars and cuffs. She was by nature a cleanly person, but not given to pretentions. She wears a handsome square brooch from the time of her marriage fastening a small embroidered collar. Her day cap shows pretty flowers made of bits of silky fabrics and wire, which adorn the small ruffles on each side of her face. A chain about her neck was attached to a little, flattened watch tucked into the waistline pocket of her bodice. She cared little about enormous petticoats, for she moved rapidly around in the events of her life. In 1837 Queen Victoria ascended the British throne and used plaids excessively in silks and Scottish woolens for herself and all her attendants at Balmoral Castle. Soon, plaids in every fiber became more fashionable throughout the English-speaking world and much of Europe. British India was putting out cheap, plaid cotton ginghams by shiploads, bought by the poorest in any British province and American dry goods stores. Patty married at age 17, having grown up in the Maine woods. Highly intelligent, she felt great compassion for others. Becoming a midwife, she had consistent successes in the nearly 4000 births she aided in her lifetime. Pattie's talented hands were always busy, taking sewing materials along as she waited for babies to be born. Crossing the plains, she darted in and out of wagons and traveled by horseback even to a company behind or ahead, wherever needed. If scraps were available to make baby clothes, or her own collars and cuffs, she sewed on them in every spare minute. Her husband, David Sessions, helped Patty raise their own large family. She rode horses well, so, for the rest of her life, she rode anywhere to put a mother ""to bed."" There, she cared for the family until the mother felt well and confident. Patty's own family became accustomed to having her leave in an instant, no matter where they lived.",LDS Archives. Also From Internet: https://mormonbloke.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/trail-of-hope/

The cap's a strip of some length of fabric to attach over the top of the head to covers almost to the hairline around the face. In this design, most of the woolen embroidery is concentrated on the rounded back fabric. There are some auxiliary fancy stitches to make the front sides pretty with more curly flowers placed near the cheeks. In different counties of Scandinavia the caps vary from very plain to heavily embroidered all over the exterior. A great number of them have a colorful binding around the edge as seen here in the popular red color. Sometimes there was a little white cap worn under it, or white lace could be around the face of either cap.","This was purchased at an antique store in the USA long ago in case Carma needed it for a costume.

440,shirtSmock.png,shirtSmock_thumb.png,1800,1840,men,pattern,A shirt and a smock of 1700s & 1800s compared,"For outerwear, a British or American smock were actually cut the same way as any linen or cotton shirt of these years for men. Plain shirts were considered as underwear in the early 1800s, so men usually wore vests over their shirts.   Note the necklines in the diagram: work shirts usually had only a collar band instead of a collar; but a heavy wool shirt for logging in winter had a pointed collar approximately 4 inches deep. This simple shirt pattern could be slightly enlarged in heavier wool to make a hunting shirt worn over the top of other clothes (seen elsewhere in a painting by artist Tait) to give another layer of warmth. Many edges of their construction were top-stitched by hand to strengthen the garment and to aid in smoothing it when it is washed.  During the 1840s there was decreasing use of a 2 inch fancy ruffle down the center front opening for about 10 inches. Such an embellishment was only used for best white linen wear, and the British kept that symbol of a fine dress shirt longer than Americans. Front yokes were usually box pleated or had vertical tucks starched and ironed on each side of the placket.  Separate starched collars for dress shirts were buttoned on after the front placket was closed with hidden buttons. Thus, we see tiny buttonholes on the bottom edge of a standing dress collar which match up with small buttons on the shirts collar band.

448,smock.png,smock_thumb.png,1800,1900,men,pattern,An American Smock with no embroidery and less smocking than European Styles. 1700  1900.,"Smocks were the most common working-mans clothing of the 1700s & 1800s in the old world and the new. This is a linen smock from America. It has smocking in front and a placket of four buttons. It is not a ""round smock,"" which would have a placket on the opposite side for reversibility. There is a little smocking at the collar line in center back. On the shoulders are double layers of linen that cover all raw edges, and are called the ""straps,"" for reinforcing the smock for (sometimes) future generations.  American smock fronts have varied smocking designs, with only two inches of smocking on the cuff-lines of the sleeves. Note that the smocking does not go all the way around the cuffs, but is centered, and simply for beauty's sake. Other pleats in the sleeve fabric attach to the side of cuff opening.  Under the rectangular arm sections are the usual seven-inch squares sewn into the sleeves and body as folded, triangular gussets. On the shoulders, the long straps, and the facings inside the smock, cover the raw seams of sleeve insertions, and are pressed inward toward the neckline. This completely covers the raw edges of the sleeves and straps. All raw edges of fabric are tuned under with small hand whip-stitching that is hardly seen on the outside of the smock, This adds strength to the garment. Such construction will survive generations of work and washing.   At the bottom of the side seam, which is French-seamed with no raw edges, we see a tiny gusset at the top of the side slit. This is to prevent side-seam tearing and is sewn securely into the hemming of the slits. There is plenty of room within this smock for a farmer to comfortably lift hay, drive a team, etc. The smock could be any neutral color of linen, or dyed dark navy blue or brown linen for little boys' smocks. In New England, Nova Scotia or Canada smocks could even be wool, subtly striped, and much longer. Wool would protect men better than linen from cold, rain, snow, and dirt.

Then it could still be used as good white linen to actually finish a long-sleeved smock for young man or older man.

CD Fig ?Corduroy trousers of greenish-gold have various types of buttons which were gathered from old clothes and a few purchases. Animal antler, white bone, wood, metal, glass   and gutta-percha were authentic materials for common buttons of the 1800s. For costumers today, modern-made matt finish plastic buttons are made to look like much older buttons of natural or dyed bone. Metal buttons were always expensive for the poor. Metal fasteners were sometimes even more expensive than the cloth for a garment.   For convenience, one button of the pants' broadfall opening may be left undone while shopping, making it easier to put a hand into the inner, heavy, muslin pocket for money.   Suspenders in dark green and red heavy cotton tape are attached to the pants higher back waistline. Suspender ends are hand sewn onto a heavy leather tab which can be slit with a tool to make a buttonhole. Suspenders were very seldom attached to each other at the crossing in back, but were each single strips.   Below, the striped, blue and white, sturdy, cotton poor-boy pants can be cinched in the back with cloth strips to fit a slim boy. The strips have no expensive buckle, but are simple cloth made to tie in a knot. We also see two bone buttons which attach to suspenders.

They moved and started a bakery in Burton-on-Trent. William was a Railroad plate layer while Mary ran the shop, but sadly lost their first baby boy. She avidly saved a great deal of money so they could take their next child to America with the Mormons. Most converts were not able to pay for their own emigration. They arrived in New Orleans 1844. The Prophet Joseph Smith was sorry that William died 3 weeks after arrival, leaving Mary with 3 child. Mary gave birth to Emma in May 1844, and the infant quickly died. She bravely purchased 10 acres north of Nauvoo and would not be crushed by the deaths nor assassinations in Nauvoo. She saw that Brigham Young was approved of Joseph to lead the people West. Henry Wooley was also from Staffordshire, England, and came on the same ship as the Bloods. As he applied for work on Mary's house, their romance sprang up, and she married him in 1845.

Her clothing is remarkably beautiful: first a tucker or chemisette over the shoulders which was tied around the waist under the dress. Over that is a dress with a deep wide neckline. Then the white silk shoulder shawl with an embroidered collar added. The simple shawl was a fringed square folded in a triangle, with 2 or 4 inch knotted fringe tied from the warp and weft of the fabric itself. Her hollow gold beads had been popular for the previous 20 years in America. The embroidery on the tucker and collar appears to have been hand stitched, though machine embroidery was in high fashion in the 1840s. Small, ordinary home sewing machines were not yet owned by the general population for another 25 years. The triangle points of edge embroidery on the sheer mull or organza collar, are flowers and ferns. The great medallion with geometric band around the neck, were all of the highest quality. Part or all may have been done by Emma herself over a period of time, or by British embroiderers in Nauvoo.

All these smaller fabric pieces had been given to the poor to be quilted for their personal wardrobes.",Above ladies' underwear drawn by Carma from the SPNEA.
