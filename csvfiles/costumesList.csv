1,0010_image.jpg,1700,1900,1800-1819,men,working,garment,"American Smock with less smocking than European styles, and no additional embroidery.","Smocks were the most common working man's clothing of the 1700s & 1800s in both the old world and the new. This is a linen smock from America with smocking in front and a placket of four buttons. There is a little smocking at the collar line in center back. (It is not a ""round smock,"" which would have a placket on the back side as well, to allow wearing it reversed.) On the shoulders are double layers of linen that cover all raw edges, and are called the ""straps,"" for reinforcing the smock. Sometimes, a strongly made smock could be used for future generations. Nothing went to waste or was thrown away if there was still some use in it. American smock fronts have varied smocking designs, with only two inches of smocking on the cuff-lines of the sleeves. Note that the smocking does not go all the way around the cuffs, but is centered, and is there simply for beauty's sake. Other pleats in the sleeve fabric attach to the side of the cuff opening. Under the rectangular arm sections are the usual seveninch squares sewn into the sleeves and body as folded, triangular gussets. On the shoulders, the long “straps,” and the facings inside the smock, cover the raw seams of sleeve insertions and are pressed inward toward the neckline. This completely covers the raw edges of the sleeves and straps. All raw edges of the fabric are turned under with small, hand whip-stitching that is hardly seen on the outside of the smock, this adds strength to the garment. Such construction will survive generations of work and washing. At the bottom of the side seam (French-seamed) is a tiny gusset at the top of the side slit to prevent side-seam tearing. There is plenty of room within this smock for a farmer to comfortably lift hay, drive a team, etc. The smock could be any neutral color of linen or dyed to a dark navy blue or brown for little boys' smocks. In New England, Nova Scotia or Canada smocks could even be wool, subtly striped, and much longer. Wool would protect men better than linen from cold, rain, snow, and dirt.",Drawn by Carma from a smock made by a Nauvoo missionary’s wife using Carma's measurements and sewing tutelage. Free use. 
2,0596_image.jpg,1800,1900,1800-1819,men,working,costume,Farmer wears a work smock and trousers.,"Of the large Germanic Whitmer family in Fayette, New York, David Whitmer had a strong mind and body. Here he wears the usual American linen smock to cover his clothing while working. If the day were hot, a farmer might wear nothing on his torso except his tough linen smock. He also wears a broad-brimmed, low crowned hat and heavy leather work shoes. David's family hosted Joseph Smith, Jr. for one month while the Prophet used this safe place to get away from life-threatening mobs while translating the Book of Mormon from ancient gold plates into English. ","This ink drawing, a portrait by Robert Barrett, is displayed in the Grandin Print Shop, Palmyra, New York. The clothing was carefully coached by Carma for the artist. "

It is fully lined with yellow and brown plaid fabric for warmth. Its sleeves have small sleeve pleats at the narrow, sewn-on cuffs. A simple 1 inch binding at the neck is of the same tunic fabric. This over-smock was used as an additional two layers of fabric that could be conveniently pulled on over the head for cold farm work. ","Drawn by Carma when this American smock was a recent acquisition at Old Sturbridge Historic Village in Sturbridge, New York. Free use. "
4,0019_image.jpg,1700,1900,1800-1819,men,working,garment,Smock from Old Sturbridge Village collection,"This man's calf-length smock hadbeen repaired, as we can see a carefully reinforced seam just left of bottom center. A tear had taken place from the front hem and upward about 15 inches. Perhaps that split in the fabric was there when the smock was first made, many years before, and had been sewn up to prevent fraying. Then the fabric could still be used as good linen to create a long-sleeved smock for a man. This design has only a square of smocking stitches in top front, no wider than the flat collar spreads. All stitching and openings are identical on front and back, making it a reversible ""Round Smock."" The sleeves have the expected section of smocking near the narrow cuffs, but not all the way around the cuffs. It had lasted a long time by being used on both, reversible sides for many years, or more than one generation. The owner donated it to the historic village. It is definitely a New England type of smock and is badly tacked up for this display. The shoulder width would have dropped a little off the farmer's shoulders when worn.","Old Sturbridge Village, a wonderful national park in Massachusetts showing historical Americana. From a booklet"
5,0011_image.jpg,1830,1840,1800-1819,men,working,costume,A blue and white striped smock over regular clothes,"A woolen smock with a squarish neckline binding added protection and warmth when worn over everything a man normally had on, even his coat, shirt, and tie. He could then go about his business in town or around his lands in very cold weather in Britain, Canada, or Northern U.S. and still keep his underneath clothing clean.","Booklet from Old Sturbridge Village, Sturbridge, Mass."

His blouse has full front and back torso, and very full sleeves under a wide collar. His hat is flat with a long ribbon around the crown that falls to his shoulders. He also has a scarf tied under his collar. The trousers are the renowned, sailor bell-bottoms. If a sailor fell into the sea, he could lift a wet bell-bottom above the waves, trap air in the voluminous leg, and hold it tight at the bottom to provide a float. Wet fabric would hold the air in for a quite a while as he waited for help. Chances are good that many sailors on older ships wore not uniform sailor garb, but whatever they had in shirts or trousers. It probably depended on the strictness of the owner, and who was paying for his clothing.",

Note the other style, which was rather an enlarged cap to surround the piled-up hairdo, but with ruffled lace around the face and under the chin and back hair, with openings for the ears. It tied under the chin. One supposes that a woman wearing this style would also carry a parasol against the sun. It was a common undertaking for a woman to buy fal-lals to redecorate her bonnets for various seasons and occasions. The black bonnet with black ribbons, bottom right, was probably a mourning bonnet, which should be worn for 6 months to 2 years after the death of a loved one (depending on a woman’s closeness to the deceased.

It would be warm in cold weather. Frockcoats of this decade ranged from upper thigh-length to calf length. An overcoat might also be of a frock design and reach to the ankles. Both these frockcoats have a very long, one-piece collar that reaches from the top coat button, all the way up, around the neck and back down. The lapel portion of the coat body was minimal – perhaps an inch. Coat collars were padded and stiffened to stand far up behind the neck, often as high as the ears, to frame the face and cravat. Tops of the sleeves are gathered to poof out and make the shoulders look wider. Waists were nipped in, often with men wearing corsets or girdles. Both carry whips and have high, flared top hats. Both men wear loose trousers strapped below the foot to prevent creases.",

Never mind that it disabled full breathing, development of torso muscles, and normal positioning of internal organs, it was STYLE! Hundreds of such ads throughout the 1800s can be found for children from infant age to girls on the brink of womanhood. Wearing a corset would accustom a young girl to wearing an ever smaller-waisted corset in womanhood, causing any number of health problems. No wonder they were always fainting. One alleged story tells of an angry husband of the 1880s who cast his unfaithful wife onto the street without her corset. So undeveloped were her torso muscles that she could not even get up and walk to safety, but lay helpless in the road.

Bell was a redheaded Scott with blue eyes. His hair is brushed forward over the temples, as was often preferred, (perhaps in an attempt to hide the loss of receding hair.) On each cheekbone, his sideburns extend into small ""muttonchops"" and are bright, curly orange. Bell’s high coat collar in back shows perfectly the way coats were padded to slope sharply from shoulder to neck, as was done in the late 1830s. Part of a button is seen just below the M-cut of his lapel, which would indicate a double-breasted coat. A high, stand-up shirt collar of stiff white linen lies against his jawbone, and a white silk tie is wrapped around the collar with not much of a knot in front. Note that the very high collar is cut into a dip in the back to avoid discomfort to neck and hairline. White ruffles spill down the bosom of his shirt. He was evidently a landed gentleman to wear such finery.

Though a self-taught and much-admired geologist, Hugh finally moved to Edinburgh where he became editor of The Witness to express his deep Christianity. Fearing that his increasing migraines and psychotic episodes might cause him to harm wife or children, he committed suicide in 1857.

Christensen's series of 10 paintings (each about 8 ft. by 10 ft.) was created during his winter rest times away from farming. He depicted early Mormon history and pioneers, and exhibited them in many cities of Mormons, north, and south, in the “Mormon Corridor” of settlements from Arizona to Northern Idaho. He linked the paintings together in a long roll, which was easiest for transporting. To each group of viewers in his journeys, Christensen explained his prepared story of early Mormon History. He unwound the scroll and described scene by scene from his wagon box if it was a small village. If possible he spoke in a primitive chapel or at a farmyard gathering --charging observers a small-price. Christensen’s efforts to show his arts gave him a slightly increased income through the long winters in the west and also allowed him to demonstrate his deep-seated beliefs.

This image shows their very different body types, but not true heights. These big men were depicted conventionally with tiny feet to indicate their refinement, and all their hair was smoothly coifed, even to Hyrum's characteristically long sideburns. They both wore light, strapped-under trousers with darker tailcoats, and sleeve cuffs turned down formally. It is barely discernible that Hyrum is also wearing a light, if not white, vest, as is Joseph. This artist made the Prophet taller than his older brother, which was not true to their actual heights but was meant to emphasize Joseph’s No.1 importance. Hyrum was actually 2 to 2 ½ inches taller than Joseph and was lean and lanky with a narrower forehead.","SOURCE: The Two Martyrs, Joseph & Hyrum Smith, an engraving from England after their deaths.

This excellent mannequin was made by Church Displays long ago. Carma designed his clothing: the first representation, ever, of the Prophet Joseph Smith wearing LINEN, which was appropriate and much used in the hot, humid weather of the Midwest. He is seated at an Empire style table made at the time of his birth, 1806. His frock coat is of pumpkin-colored linen with a pleated opening in the center back skirt. Thin white piping surrounds all edges of his coat but the hemline. Pocket flaps over his hips are sewn into the waistline seam and are also piped in white. Buttons in the front tabs are medium-sized while those on the coat cuffs are small. Two buttons at the back waistline pleats are large. All are made to look like the correct white bone for that period. This design was made after a white linen frock coat which was an 1845 antique Carma bought in the Northeast USA (shown elsewhere). Smith's trousers are cotton/linen of narrow, equal stripes of beige and soft green. They have bottom straps, buttoned under the shoe sole to hold trousers neatly down on the leg. A vest of mottled beige linen with a shawl collar covers his fine white linen shirt. Small black and gold designs grace the silky cravat which wraps around his standing collar to button in the back. His boots have proper square toes.","SOURCES: The LDS Historic Sites Exhibits made this accurate mannequin and originally put it in Joseph Smith’s Vermont Birthplace Site. However, the clothing was totally incorrect. Later they enlarged the site and asked Carma to make new and better clothes. She dressed him entirely in linen for the hot sticky weather of the Midwest, seated at a Nauvoo table with assorted papers he owned and used. Never before had he been shown wearing proper linen for an Illinois summer. Years later, when this exhibit was exchanged for another, it was all transported to Salt Lake City and warehoused. In the 1980s, Carma desired some of the clothing for display, and the Church gave her the entire mannequin, plus the use of Church furniture. It was placed behind glass in the 2005 Joseph Smith 200th Birthday Exhibit in the Joseph Smith Building on BYU Campus. Carma made all this clothing and used her own 1840s books to display on the table. The exhibit extended to 6 months, allowing 33,000 people to view this scene of 11 dressed mannequins over the summer and into winter. It joined with displays showing men, women, and children of Joseph's entire lifetime (1805-1844). Clothing and hair designed by Carma, and clothing made by Carma.

An old vest of the l830s is buttoned up very high, but shows the silk of his tie. His frock coat is completely skirted, and his shoulders are free of padding, making them narrow at the sleeve tops. Above a starched, turned-down collar and a bow tie, Smith still had considerable gray hair cut below his earlobes (portrait of face and hairstyle is elsewhere in this document). Even with the best of clothes in the mid-1800s, it was impossible to keep shined shoes because of muddy or dusty roads of hard beaten earth everywhere people could walk. This gentle man lived a very reverent and spiritual life to his death. Smith was tall and lanky all his life, which caused unusual difficulties for photographers. They always used photo stands to hold the necks of subjects steady for the full required time of exposing the image. But the man had to find enough books to stack behind John in order to get his stand high enough to grip the back of John’s neck. The stand is seen behind John’s calves, humorously resting on top of the stacked books. Still, the slight blur of his hands indicates a little movement. The necessity of remaining perfectly motionless for up to 90 seconds is why most old photos show unsmiling faces. After his brother, Joseph Smith Sr. died in Nauvoo, John became Patriarch to the entire Church. Later, in Salt Lake City, John was called by Brigham Young to be president of the first large Salt Lake Stake.

When Joseph sent him to England to open a mission, he was horrified to have to face many well-dressed, educated English people: but he felt called by God and was determined to go. A former friend, Lyman Johnson, met him on the streets of early Nauvoo, and, learning of his intense desire to go, took the fine cloak off his own back, and put it on Heber. Johnson, himself, was faltering in the LDS Church at that time but was so impressed with Kimball’s strong faith, he donated his own best cloak to Kimball to encourage him! Such clothing would be absolutely necessary to cross the Atlantic and brave the winds and rains of Britain. This cloak most likely had an expensive rain caplet over the shoulders, valuable for Heber's years in Britain, with much walking outdoors to preach.","Source: Orson F. Whitney, The Life of Heber C.

Carma handled the cloak and pulled open the yarns of the lining. There she found that it was not originally brown, but bright green in the early construction of the cloak. The cloak was handed back to the Bills family after Joseph’s death.

High-quality cotton was custom made into a reproduction dress for a 20th Century missionary to Nauvoo. The bodice and sleeves are cut on the bias, which makes both a better fit on the model and more puff in the sleeves. The bodice front has a false band with buttons, (though it actually has a back opening with a hidden, modern zipper for the lady-missionary's convenience) that is made to look like old hooks. The sleeves are shirred in six lines around the top, then backed with a flat piece of the same fabric and fit into the slightly dropped armholes. The sleeves are very full at the wrist, and gathered into a narrow buttoned band. All the seams in back and around the waistline and neckline are self-corded. Six inches above the hemline is a shirred bias band with a larger decorative cording top and bottom to make a pleasing self-décor (and much work sewing correctly). The back side of the hem is faced in polished cotton of a cheaper fabric, as was done for hundreds of years before textiles became inexpensive.","SOURCE: Made by Carma for Mary Brown Firmage Woodward, for her mission in mid-1990s.

Her hollow gold beads had been popular for the previous 20 years in America. The embroidery on the tucker and collar appears to have been hand-stitched, though machine embroidery was in high fashion in the 1840s. Small, ordinary home sewing machines would not be owned by the general population for another 25 years. The triangle points of edge-embroidery on the sheer mull or organza collar, are flowers and ferns.

Mary gave birth to Emma in May 1844, and the infant quickly died. She bravely purchased 10 acres north of Nauvoo and would not be crushed by the deaths nor assassinations in Nauvoo. She saw that Brigham Young was approved of Joseph to lead the people West. Henry Wooley was also from Staffordshire, England, and came on the same ship as the Bloods.

He clipped the wool from his sheep, cleaned the wool: washed, carded, dyed raw wool in bundles with red, black, and blue colors. Then he spun the wool rolags (carded wool hanks) into threads for the loom, took extra effort to string the loom, and wove the plaid yardage. The fabric was carefully steam pressed to help smooth and shrink the fabric before cutting it The husband then cut out the dress pieces and hand sewed all parts of the bodice and lining together. Tiny buttons were applied to ribbon designs down the double-tucked bodice front. These were very expensive brass buttons made in the design of a slightly flattened, hollow, cone shape with a shank for sewing on.","A mannequin years ago was just being prepared for display in the Salt Lake City DUP Museum.

This silk dress bodice for a teenage girl is entirely hand sewn by amazingly tiny hand stitches, observable with slightly off-color thread. The gathering of the skirt is an excellent example of “cartridge pleating”, in which several rows of short in-and-out stitches are gathered together to make “cartridge” shaped pleats that extend down onto the skirt 1 or 2 inches. This dress view also shows quarter-inch self-piping around the waistline where the bodice and skirt meet in a V-shape.

The fabric could be washable cotton or linen on the inside and satin-weave cotton on the outside for a woman of some means. This would not always be white, as some women ordered a cheerful print or favorite color of fabric. Laces in back were adjusted by a friend or maid, then the woman could fasten herself in front. Flexible stiffness is added in casings of fabric all around that contain insertions of “whalebone” (baleen--the long, thin straining ""teeth"" of a whale's mouth). Baleen was long-lasting and helped ensure a small waist over full hips, with erectness in front to prevent wrinkles. Exaggerated hips were sewn to flare outward, thus further emphasizing the small waistline. In the early 1800s, corsets flared up and out from the waist to support but not cover the breasts, allowing for a deep décolletage and breasts swelling above a low neckline (much seen in Regency clothing). Later, breasts were covered, allowing for padding over small bosoms. Even today, research shows that a wide ratio of bust & hip to waistline is especially attractive to men -- thus the unhealthy 1800s crushing of waist and ribs.

Quilted for warmth. 2 Waistband with a button. 3 Outside of hem with a much-worn tape binding. 4 Inside of hem. Rose fabric was not long enough, so a band of green was added to the inner length. DESCRIPTION: A pretty petticoat may not be seen, but adds to the pleasure of the wearer. A padded and quilted petticoat gave warmth and fullness, as seen in color images from an early Utah settlement. A rose outer fabric is padded with stretched and thinned ""rolags,"" of the carded wool. A green, printed cotton as a partial inside lining increases the durability of the garment. It is more broadly padded from the lower half to the hem from wool that was carded to smooth the fibers. The structure requires a strong cotton fabric waistband with a handy metal button. The bottom edge is bound in woven black woolen tapes and narrow strips of cloth. Only small anchoring stitches keep the fibers carefully in place; it is not closely quilted. The curator at the Museum in Fairview, Utah, wondered if it could have been padded with alpaca fibers rather than Utah's ordinary 2 or 3 kinds of sheep wool. Carma doubted alpaca use, since NO alpacas came with early pioneers, and were unknown in Utah until recently.","Petticoat seen in the Fairview, Utah DUP Museum. Photos by Carma. Free use."

Ca. 1850.,"The outer skirt fabric was mustard gold alpaca for warmth, lined in bright green cotton with tiny star prints. Gold quilting thread was used, and a 3/4 inch metal button at the waist. It was fashioned out of various widths of fabric sewn together to make an A-line shape and then the top was pleated only a little onto the waistband fabric, which was light brown and white woven cotton. To make the petticoat stiffer in its 31-inch length, the upper section shows diagonal quilting lines all on a slant with less cotton or wool padding near the waistline. The lower-center band of quilting has multiple ""seashells"" or ""clouds,"" while the bottom has horizontal stitching in 6 bands, 1 inch wide, to hold the petticoat (and thus the dress) out more fully. This quilting pattern shows the artistry of a highly experienced seamstress, who bound the hemline with 1-inch wide velvet of dark brown or originally black. It is a similar quilting pattern to the glazed rose cotton petticoat above.","Fairview, Utah, DUP Museum, Courtesy of Nancy West. Drawn on-site by Carma. Free use."

Around the waist is a tape that is tied or buttoned for comfort. The wires do not extend over the stomach, so a woman can sit without her hoop bulging forward. When it wasn’t being worn, the hoop could collapse into a flat circle for storage. Usually, petticoats were worn over the hoops to smooth the surface of the skirt. In the 60s, hoops became enormously wide, shown in many parody illustrations of hoops seven ft. in diameter, requiring that a dress be lowered over the upper body by two maids on stools with longs sticks and pulleys (shown in 1860s fashion.)",Crinoline drawn by Carma.

A scarf tied around the neck under the collar was standard, and men always wore hats out-of-doors. The hat top left is called a “pilot cap.”",United American Costume Display.

He later organized the Provo Woolen Mills, utilizing wool grown in Utah, plus other wools that were superior to Utah's. Such mills went some way to making Church members self-sustainable, both in using Utah wool and employing their own teens to attend to mill machinery. When Utah connected to wider world markets, better woolens became available. Eventually, the mills in Utah closed down, and the buildings were used for other purposes.","Frank Ellwood Esshom, Pioneers and Prominent Men of Utah, (Salt Lake City, Utah, Western Epics Inc. 1966).

They add interest down the bodice and in a large front section of the skirt. Ruffles of the same fabric outline the skirt panel. Sleeves of solid-color silk begin at her low-shoulder with wide pleats down to small pleats at narrow wrist cuffs. Very obvious is a hexagonal belt buckle with a perforated design inside its rim. Her hair has side curls in rolls, one of which sits forward over her cheeks on each side. Much of her hairstyle is indistinct due to a full-hair snood which covers the style from forehead to back neck. A side hair ornament, possibly of metal, keeps the snood and curls in place. Growing up in Cambridgeshire, England, Hannah found it difficult to draw close to women who were not as well educated as she, or could not match her own level of creative expression in writing. Her talents found full range in Salt Lake City, Utah, where she contributed much to the Woman's Exponent and intellectual organizations.

Although they had been introduced a decade earlier, the 1860s were the hay-day of hoopery! Women of all classes wore them as they could afford to. Many construction materials had been tried to support this exaggerated fullness of skirts (sometimes up to 6 ft across!). First: multiple petticoats of stiff, horsehair fabric were tried but were too heavy. Also whalebone (often fragile), and brass wire (ridgid), with, finally, thin strips of flexible steel covered in fabric padding. The steel rings did not extend over the stomach front but ended at the side hips. This allowed a girl to sit down without the hoops flying up over her head. As she sat, she gracefully gathered the lower back hoops up and under her knees. (What price beauty?) This illustration shows the half-girl in her bedroom (right) with a hoopskirt over her chemise and corset.

Ca. late 1870s.,"Osmond Broad Shaw of Staffordshire, England, is probably in his 70s here. He wears the full beard and mustache more typical of older men. Men wore their hair short, but not every man in 1870 wore full beards, and younger men who did so usually trimmed them shorter than this example. (Osmond is shown in the 1840s with his wife Eliza, young and handsome!) In his youth, Shaw was a man of excellent English education in history, languages, and chemical science, taught and encouraged by his renowned schoolmaster father, Simeon Shaw. Unknown to each other, Osmond and his fiancée, Eliza, had separately and secretly joined the persecuted Church of Jesus Christ LDS in the late 1840s. A week before their marriage they had to admit to each other their hidden but staunch beliefs, no matter what the cost. Their confessions caused a dramatic burst of happiness for both! Laboring to be able to leave for America, both of them worked tirelessly to pay off debts and afford travel. Young, educated Osmond put on his old clothing 6 days a week and labored at the lowest working man's level packing in huge containers of straw the beautiful Spode and Wedgewood china wares for out-shipping. Eliza, an exquisite needle-woman, labored making stays (2-piece corsets,) for her demanding customers long hours each day. Upon their journey, they lost two babies to cholera in infested St. Louis, Missouri. Osmond and Eliza barely survived, but eventually made it to Salt Lake City. Finally, living happily amid the western Latter-Day Saints, and blessed with more children, Eliza's and Osmond's skills continued in sewing, fine carpentry, and in producing the first poured window glass in Salt Lake City.

Born of an affluent family with the advantages of an excellent education for mind and talents, Serge descended from a line of high nobility in Switzerland. Encountering Church of Jesus Christ LDS missionaries in 1852, while still young, he firmly accepted their message. A spiritual man brought up in Pietistic traditions, he was the only one of his immediate family who was baptized into the Church. Courageously, Serge traveled alone to America. In later years, after much and varied service in missionary work, Ballif became President of the Swiss-German Mission.

Note- there are no hoops over the lap so a woman might sit or bend without the front flipping up. She wore a petticoat over the hoops to allow the skirt to lie smoothly and without ridges. In cold weather, she might wear a number of petticoats beneath the crinoline to keep warm. In hot weather, the absence of under-petticoats would allow for some air circulation.

(Working women and the less-wealthy could not afford the cost or inconvenience of trains. Feminists decried trains as a spreader of dirt and disease.) But in the mid-1880s, bustles came back and grew from modest and hip-high to large and just below the waistline. As the decade marched on, those high bustles became more and more voluminous. At the same time, corsets extended down onto the hips for the dropped- waist and included a long front busk (stiff bone or metal insertion) that actually forced a woman to bend her body into a breasts-forward-bottom-protruding S shape. If she didn’t obey the busk, it might pierce her low-stomach clothing and even her skin. (Were fashion designers sadists, or did they care more for the money earned from changing the fashions more than the comfort of women?) There was even sold a cage of flat metal strips that prevented splitting corset bones from piercing the skin. But by 1889 into the 1890s, the fashion changed again. Now waists were even smaller, bustlines were lower, and the enormous bustle was gone. Padded petticoats, however, filled out the hips to emphasize the tiny waistline.","Pinterest, attributed to Temps d’elegance."

Four layers of deep pink, looped, 9-inch ribbon lie atop the bustle.

The right dress has swags of checked purple fabric separated by tightly-pressed trims of grape pleating and ruching. Details emphasize more, more, more!

Bustles and fullness made 1880 skirts voluminous. Thus, hats are fairly small and close to the head. That would reverse in the 1890s. Here we have women with curled bangs wearing an assortment of much decorated, but fairly close-fitting bonnets. They are made of shaped felt, woven straw, and free-form fabric, probably over buckram hat forms beneath. Bonnets and hats were a very important accessory, as a woman would not be seen out-of-door without a bonnet, except sometimes in her own yard or garden. Thus, procuring a few hats that would match outdoor dresses was essential. Lace and feathers abound, as do tie-on ribbons of satin and lace. Bonnet at center bottom seems to have a bird on top with a head-frill and long pink tail-feathers trailing behind.

Later, in the 1890s, the hipline became lower and rounded, and the back of the corset extended only a little farther than the hips did. There were even corsets to fit plumper ladies who might endure 28-inch cinching (center right), rather than the desired 16-18 inch waist for young ladies (bottom row). Corsets laced up in the back so a woman could adjust a new bustle to her desired waistline, with assistance. Once adjusted, the corset hooked up the front so a woman could put it on herself. One primary purpose of the corset was to support the breasts. Modern bras were not invented until 1914. None of the bustles or corsets felt comfortable. They were unhealthy for internal organs, and required shallow breathing. But that was the price of “beauty” for the age.","Seen on Pinterest, no attribution given."

Another factor was that hoops sometimes flipped up, exposing the legs. Thus, pretty trims on drawer-legs were important, as seen here. They ended inches above the skirt hem on the chance that the skirt might flip up. What is horrifying to modern women is the fact that drawers had no crotch covering. The crotch seam was open from fore to aft so that ladies could use both hands to hold up all their undergirdings during toilet functions, and merely had to squat over a pot of some kind. Besides, the corset held the top of pantalets solid against the waist and hips so there was no chance of pulling drawers down for toilet functions. This was one reason maidens were always accompanied by an older woman when men were around.","Ladies Drawers catalog, Seen on Pinterest – attribution to “Photo by CharmaineZoe on Flickr.”"

Even one skirt-length seam could take an hour to sew properly, and might later need to be unpicked (another half hour or more) to re-sew the seam looser or tighter to fit the body (a third hour). Women were judged by how tiny and straight they could make their stitches. Dressmaker assistants to reputable dress designers often had to work in dim back-rooms or by candle-light. Once sewing machines were available, the same seam could be finished more perfectly and sturdily in minutes. Clothing patterns became available for home use, allowing many women to become quite capable of sewing clothes for their own families. Other women became proficient enough to start their own home dressmaker’s business in recreating fashions from fashion plates and photographs of the “latest thing.” This mother with a small daughter (and a parrot and cat) rejoices in her own pretty 1885 dress of tiny waist and swathed hips over a bustle.

(An electric iron with an adjustable thermostat was not invented until 1935.) But ironing did have to be done, especially on cotton and linen clothing, that wrinkled dreadfully after washing. Cool irons were necessary for silks, voiles, and fragile fabrics. So some professionals and tailors might have an “iron-heating ► stove” on which many irons could be continually heating. The stove was kept filled with coal or wood via the drawer you see below, right. Wood or leather handles were changeable from iron to iron as needed. Folks without electricity bought a few, solid, cast irons and heated them on the kitchen stove, alternating irons as they cooled off.","First image seen on Pinterest -- Attributed to s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com, all decades of 1800s Second image -- Iron heating stove from Wikipedia.org in their article, “Ironing.”"

The lower back of the coat has folds, pin-ups, and curving tucks of the coat fabric to make a very modest, rounded bustle over the top of diagonally pleated panels (seen in the back view). A colored ribbon is tucked into the bustle folds. Above the bustle are 8 vertical pin-tucks, clustered into a lower fastening. The coat cuffs are of fabric ruching with ruffles top and bottom, with a tiny lace ruffle below, just at the wrist. Such clever details make this coat enchanting. Her dress is made of horizontal bands of ruching, alternating wide and narrow across her bodice. The top of the bodice is smooth and possibly sheer, with a lace ruffle around her neck. That ruffle is bound to the bodice with cording. Below her hips are five solid ruffles in her skirt, ending at the same level as her coat hem. The lowest skirt segment is of tightly pressed pleats. Below white stockings, her buttoned ankle boots have a scalloped opening and top binding. The heels are only a half-inch high for a little girl.",Seen on Pinterest under 1800 girls dresses.

Most bonnets are taller than the heads beneath. Jackets cover overskirts, with underskirts below. Ribbons and lace make up two outfits. Pleats and swags adorn the rest. Ankle boots with gaiters are on some feet below white or colored stockings. Only one girl dares step into the water. Two girls have fishnets, and one carries a toy boat, but only one seems desirous of entering the water. This may be a cold and windy shore to inspire such warm clothing.","Seen on Pinterest under 1800 girls dresses, attributed to a Spanish fashion advertisement."
